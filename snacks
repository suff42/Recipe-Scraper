      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cut the rind off the top of each Camembert leaving a 1cm rim (reserving the boxes for baking). Pick the tips off three rosemary sprigs and poke into the soft cheeses, then peel and finely slice the garlic, drizzle with olive oil and poke those in too. Sprinkle each cheese with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then pop one in its box in the centre of the heart, and another on a separate tray. Reserve the third cheese for later.",
      "Strip the remaining rosemary leaves and dot between the dough balls. Sprinkle with a good pinch of salt from a height, and drizzle with olive oil. Place the bread heart in the oven with the second cheese on the shelf below and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the Camemberts are gooey and the bread is risen and golden. As soon as you serve the first two cheeses, bake the third one in its box for about 20 minutes, then swap with the eaten ones. Delicious."

      "I like to use the bags of frozen fruit you can easily get in the supermarket – they’re so convenient, and a bit of a staple in the Oliver household. I use unsweetened almond milk in my smoothies, but you can use regular milk, or fresh juice (but bear in mind it will be sweeter), if you prefer. You can add all sorts of delicious extras to these smoothies: vanilla is really nice in the berry smoothie, and fresh ginger is fantastic in the mango, passion fruit and mint version.",
      "Add all the ingredients to a blender (removing any herb stalks first), fasten the lid and whiz until nice and smooth – you might need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides to help it along. Pour into cups, then serve. At this point you could pour the mixture into ice-lolly moulds and freeze them – they’re always a big hit with my kids. Tricks & tips: For baby, serve for pudding with an extra spoon of yoghurt. For more information on stages of complimentary feeding, click here."

To test if it’s hot enough, drop a tiny piece of dough into the pan – if it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, it’s about right. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower 3 to 4 dough circles into the pan.

      "Jam tarts are definitely a part of my childhood. They are humble, cheap to make and such a pretty little treat. It’s funny how simple pastry with a blob of jam can turn into something so exciting, with chewy bits, bubbling bits, crunchy bits and jammy jelly bits. Even if you cheat a little, and buy ready-made pastry, just the ritual of filling these tarts with your favourite jams and then baking them can be really relaxing. The beauty of these for me is playing with the different jam or jelly flavours so you get a rainbow of colours. Just about every supermarket in Britain stocks a great selection of posh jams: strawberry, blackberry, blueberry, gooseberry, apricot, cranberry ... the sheer number of fillings available now makes these even more exciting than the ones I had as a kid.",
      "Put the flour, sugar and butter into a food processor with a pinch of sea salt and pulse until you have a mixture that looks like breadcrumbs. Crack in the egg, grate in the zest from your orange or lemon and pulse again, adding a little splash of milk to bring everything together, if needed. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and pop it into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out the pastry so it’s 0.5cm thick. Get yourself a few 12-hole jam tart trays (or cook the tarts in batches) and a fluted pastry cutter just a little bigger than the holes of the tray (normally around 6cm). Cut out rounds of pastry and gently push them into the wells so they come up the sides. Any leftover pastry can be gently pushed back into a ball and rolled out to make a few more tarts. Put 1 heaped teaspoon of filling into each jam tart, interspersing and alternating the flavours of jams, curds or jellies.",
      "Pop the trays on the middle shelf of the oven and cook for around 12 to 15 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the filling is thick and bubbling. Remove from the oven, leave in the tray to firm slightly, then transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool for a few minutes before serving.",
      "PS: I know this might sound a bit girly, but if you can track down a lovely old tart tin from an antique shop, then serve these straight out of the tin – it looks really good, as the old tins are really cute. See, I told you it was girly!"

      "I know you can buy shortbreads everywhere these days, but great as some of those biscuits can be, nothing comes close to a batch cooked that day, or even that week. It’s having the real version of something, rather than the ‘buy one get one free’ version, that makes us appreciate it. The simplicity of these biscuits makes them a wonderful base for desserts with cream and fruit, or a crumbly topping for trifles and stewed fruits. But for me the very best way to celebrate this humble biscuit is with a cup of tea. You can have these biscuits plain, or scent them with everything from lemon or tangerine, to lavender, lemon thyme or caraway seeds. Just don’t go mad with these flavours, because a little goes a long way and these are nicest when the flavours are subtle.",
      "Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3. Mix the flour and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Rub in the butter with your thumb and forefinger, then add your chosen flavourings (if you’re using chocolate or seeds you might want to push these into the dough at the end, after you’ve rolled it out) and squash, pat and push it into a dough. Don’t knead it, you just want to pat it down flat. Push or roll it out until it’s 1cm thick – do this directly on to a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper so you don’t have to move it. Once it’s in the shape you like – which could be square, round, or a few small finger-shapes – feel free to thumb or pinch the edges. If it splits or tears, just press it back together – but remember, the less you work the dough, the shorter and better these biscuits will be.",
      "If you want to score lines on the shortbread so that you can click the biscuits off into pieces later, you can. Sprinkle over some caster sugar, then pop the baking sheet into the oven and cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Keep an eye on it – you want a lovely light golden colour (unless you’re making the lavenderhoney version, which will be darker). Leave to cool, then put away in a tin or serve. These will be delicious for two or three days and make a lovely present for someone special."

The Welsh cooks of old did a lot of cooking on bakestones, which are essentially round cast iron skillets. They'd place them over a fire in their home, and use them for things like these sweet little cakes, which have a crisp outside and a soft, slightly crumbly inside that is to die for. You can replicate that bakestone style of cooking using a heavy-bottomed non-stick pan. I love serving these warm as they are or filled with a spoonful of cream and a few berries. Jim was using chunks of chocolate, different dried fruits and even sprinkles of desiccated coconut, so feel free to experiment once you’ve mastered the basic recipe. ”",

Once that’s well blended add your sugar and whiz again so you’ve got a lovely spiced sugar. Because there’s quite a bit of moistness in the zest and vanilla pod it’s a good idea to pour the sugar onto a baking tray, spread it out evenly then leave it to dry for a few hours.",

If you’re feeling a bit creative you can divide the popcorn between some little sandwich bags, tie them with ribbons then give them out as a bit of a Christmas treat to adults and kids. If the sugar settles on the bottom of the bag just give the bag a shake before tucking in.",
      "Put a few lugs of oil and your butter in a large pan over a high heat. Once the butter has melted, add the popcorn and stir well to coat the kernels. Put the lid on straight away and leave it for a few minutes. It will take a few minutes to get going so be patient. As the popcorn gets going give the pan a shake every 30 seconds or so to make sure the kernels all get popped. Put your spiced sugar in a large bowl and when the popcorn is ready add it to the bowl and quickly toss it and stir it into the sugar so the hot popcorn picks up those lovely spiced flavours.",
      "Serve the popcorn in a big bowl or in little bowls dotted about the house. I can honestly say, hand on heart, that this is one of the nicest popcorns I’ve ever had. It’s delicious and has to be better for you than caramels, toffees or cheap artificial sweets."

Even cocktail combinations are good. I would also sneak into the pub for some cider shandy to make lolly pops!",

      "Personally, I like to make a sort of bruschetta with them or put them out on a platter with some nice cheese. As it’s Christmas and your kitchen is probably well-stocked, you’ll hopefully have the ingredients for the bruschetta on hand already. If not, you can always improvise with whatever you’ve got in the fridge.",
      "Preheat your oven to 110ºC/225ºF/gas ¼. Lay your figs, cut-side up, in a baking tray. Using a fine grater, zest your clementines over the figs then dust the figs with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a teaspoon of sugar. My flavoured sugar is also great for this so if you’ve made a batch of that, feel free to use that instead.",
      "Pop the figs in the oven to bake for 4 hours, checking on them every hour or so. When they come out of the oven you’ll have semi-dehydrated figs, which will be a bit like wine gums.",
      "Fig bruschetta\nGet yourself a few slices of nice warm bread, crumble over some lumps of cheese, and a few pieces of walnut then put a few fig halves and a drizzle of runny honey over the top to finish it off. I think the combination of salty goat’s cheese with these figs and a bit of honey is absolute heaven.",
      "Figs in honey\nYou’ll be able to put any leftover figs to good use in all sorts of ways. A really nice way of using them at Christmas is to turn them into a bit of a gift by popping a stack of them in a sterilised jar, covering them completely with honey then sealing the jar with an airtight lid. They’ll be beautiful as part of a cheese platter, baked in a tart, a sticky toffee pud, or even thrown into a roasting tray with some pork or other meat for a bit of added sweetness. Give them to your mates when you go round to theirs for dinner. They’ll love getting something unique, especially when you explain all the different things they can do with them."

That might be an old wives’ tale, but if it is, I don’t care because I like the story. OK, they’re not the healthiest things on the planet, but every now and then . . . they’re not going to hurt you.",

Add the corn, sliced spring onions, grated cheese and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and use a fork or a spoon to mix it up really well. Once your batter is ready, pour your vegetable oil into a large sturdy pan and put it on a high heat. Please make sure you don’t move the pan about and that no one is running around the kitchen while you’re doing this, as hot oil can burn quite badly.",
      "You want the oil to reach about 180ºC, so if you don’t have a thermometer get a small piece of potato and drop it into the pan. When it turns crisp and golden and rises to the top, the oil is ready to go. Get a tablespoonful of mix and carefully drop it into the hot oil. In Georgia they roll their batter into round balls, but I say just let it drop off the spoon: a bit scruffy and rustic feels right to me. You’ll need to cook them in batches.",
      "Keep your eye on them and let them fry for about 3 to 4 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Sprinkle over a tiny bit of sea salt and a hit of paprika to finish them off, and serve right away, either on their own or as they do at roadside restaurants, as part of a meal with the amazing pork and slaw. Naughty but nice!"

      "Pigeon gets a bad rap, but good wild country birds (not the mangy kind you see wandering around cities!) produce one of the most delicious and underrated meats in the world (as long as it’s cooked medium rare). In the past, I’ve seared pigeon breast, put it inside some lovely bread and had people tell me it’s the best steak sandwich they’ve ever had! So here’s how it’s done ... This makes a brilliant casual lunch, dinner or snack with a nice salad.",
      "Turn the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Put the onions into a large pan on a medium low heat and add a lug of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and white pepper, the sugar and the thyme leaves. Put the lid on and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. After this time, remove the lid, turn the heat up to high and give the onions a good stir, then add the vinegar and stir again. Leave the lid off and continue to cook down until the onions are really sticky and slightly golden. Keep your eye on them.",
      "Put the ciabatta into the hot oven. Heat a large non-stick pan on a high heat. Finely chop the rosemary leaves and put them into a mixing bowl. Add the pigeon breasts, drizzle over some olive oil, season with salt and pepper and grate over a few scrapings of nutmeg. Toss the pigeon until coated. Once the pan is really hot, add a lug of olive oil and the bay leaves and put in the breasts, skin side down so they crisp up nicely. Cook for around 2½ minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other side for tender and blushing medium- rare meat, which trust me is what you want – anything over that and it will be tough and boring. As you remove the pan from the heat, shake in a few good drizzles of Worcestershire sauce, then toss the meat in the juices. Move to a board and slice thinly at an angle.",
      "Get the warm bread out of the oven, open it out with a serrated knife, put it on a nice board and spread as much mustard as you dare on one side (be confident – you can spread a little butter on if you want, but I don’t because the meat juices are enough). Put big pinches of watercress and those sticky onions down one side. Arrange the slices of pigeon around the sandwich, then dollop small amounts of cottage cheese in and around the meat. Push the top of the sandwich down and hold it for a couple of seconds so it sucks up all those juices. You can stab a knife through the sandwich to hold it together when you take it to the table. Serve next to a pint of good British ale."

      "This dish is only as good as the vegetables you buy, so use that as your starting point and you'll be on to an absolute winner! Here are some tips on buying and preparing a selection of veg...",
      "In most supermarkets these days you can get fresh baby carrots with their green tops. Leave about an inch of the tops on and just give the carrots a scrub.",
      "Do the same with some lovely radishes. You can get some marbled pink and white oval ones now, which are crunchy and peppery. Again, leave the tops on as these make good handles when it comes to dipping.",
      "Use nice crunchy lettuces. Sweeter lettuces like cos and romaine are good for dipping – I try to use the inner part, keeping the outer leaves for another salad. I leave the stalk on and then cut the lettuce into quarters, and that way they stay in one piece, but you don't have to do this. The important thing is to get good chunks of vegetables. I like to contrast the sweet lettuces with slightly more bitter ones like radicchio or endive.",
      "If you've got some young asparagus that's just come into season, it's really nice eaten raw. Feel free to use your imagination on the veggie side. Little fingers of celery or celeriac are also good. However, you often come across people who use raw cauliflower with dips – I personally would prefer colonic irrigation! I think cauliflower and broccoli are just awful eaten raw, so I wouldn't suggest using them here.",
      "Put the yoghurt in a food processor, pick in the mint leaves and whiz up for half a minute or so. Add the peas and the Parmesan, and whiz again – the peas will break down and the yoghurt will become green.",
      "Put the dip in a bowl, correcting the seasoning with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. When you add the lemon juice and peas to the yoghurt, quite often it splits and turns into a kind of cheese, but this is absolutely fine. It depends on the type of yoghurt you use and how acidic your lemon is. Just pour away any excess water. Usually, though, it doesn't split and is more like a purée, but both ways are good.",
      "Serve your veggies on a big board or in a big bowl next to the dip. And have some salt and pepper to hand in case you need it. It's a good sociable way to start a meal."
