This stage needs careful attention – stir to keep it from catching on the bottom, but do not reduce the heat too much.",
      "Keep it simmering for about 1 hour – put a timer on for every 10 minutes and keep checking it. Before long it will turn golden brown and thicken. From this point, check it every 5 minutes, stirring well as it can catch quickly. It will deepen in colour and form a syrupy consistency. Cook until it becomes a rich, deep coppery brown, syrupy thick and sweet.",
      "Let it cool a little, then pour into a sterilised jar. Store in the fridge and warm it a little when you want to use it.",
      "Make your ice cream. Have a basin of iced water standing by, then halve the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds.",
      "Heat the cream and vanilla seeds in a pan over a medium heat until the surface just shimmers and the liquid is about to simmer, then remove from the heat.",
      "Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and caster sugar, stir in a little of the vanilla cream, then add the remaining cream.",
      "Return the mixture to the pan and stir it over a low heat until thickened and the custard coats the back of a spoon.",
      "Remove from the heat and set over the iced water to cool. This mixture can be made a day ahead and stored in the fridge.",
      "Once the custard has cooled, fold in the dulce de leche and churn in an ice cream machine or freeze in a suitable container. If you are not using an ice cream machine, stir the ice cream after a couple of hours to break up any large ice crystals. Freeze and eat within one week.",
      "For the fritters, combine the cinnamon and caster sugar in a bowl and set aside.",

      "Drop dessertspoonfuls of the mixture into the oil – they will rise and sizzle, making puffy, odd-shaped little fritters. Cook 2 to 3 at a time – don’t crowd the pan or the fritters will become soggy.",

      "Spoon the marmalade into a small pan and melt over a low heat, add a splash of water if needed to loosen, and keep warm.",
      "Now to assemble the cake: using a ladle as your measure, spoon just enough batter into the cake tin to cover the base – you’ll probably need to fill the ladle to about two-thirds.",
      "Use a pastry brush to spread the mixture evenly over the base of the tin, so it just covers the surface, then cook under the grill for 4 minutes, or until set and golden all over.",
      "Ladle another thin layer of batter on top, and return to the grill. Once golden, brush a thin layer of the softened marmalade over the cake – you want just enough for a thin glaze.",
      "Continue layering and grilling, glazing with marmalade every second or third layer, until the batter is used up – you should get 15 to 18 layers.",
      "Brush the top of the cake with a good layer of marmalade, then run a knife around the outside of the cake. Leave to cool, then cover with clingfilm and chill for a few hours, or overnight, to set.",
      "A couple of hours before you’re ready to serve, break the chocolate into pieces and melt with the remaining 50g butter in a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of simmering water. Once completely melted and glossy, stir through the rum, then set it aside for 10 minutes to cool.",
      "Remove the cake from the tin and set it on a serving plate. Pour on the chocolate sauce and use a spatula to spread it evenly over the top, letting it drizzle down the sides.",
      "Leave it to set slightly, then garnish with the toasted flaked almonds, before leaving it to cool completely. Serve with a big mug of tea or a festive sherry. This cake keeps really well in a tin for up to 2 days (not that it’ll be around that long!)."

      "I like to use the bags of frozen fruit you can easily get in the supermarket – they’re so convenient, and a bit of a staple in the Oliver household. I use unsweetened almond milk in my smoothies, but you can use regular milk, or fresh juice (but bear in mind it will be sweeter), if you prefer. You can add all sorts of delicious extras to these smoothies: vanilla is really nice in the berry smoothie, and fresh ginger is fantastic in the mango, passion fruit and mint version.",
      "Add all the ingredients to a blender (removing any herb stalks first), fasten the lid and whiz until nice and smooth – you might need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides to help it along. Pour into cups, then serve. At this point you could pour the mixture into ice-lolly moulds and freeze them – they’re always a big hit with my kids. Tricks & tips: For baby, serve for pudding with an extra spoon of yoghurt. For more information on stages of complimentary feeding, click here."

Melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until dark and frothy. Add the brown butter to the blitzed pumpkin with the sugar, flour, nutmeg, ½ teaspoon of cinnamon and the vanilla extract. Whisk 2 eggs in a separate bowl, add to the processor, then blitz again until well combined. Transfer the mixture to the cooled pastry case, using a fork or spoon to spread it out evenly.",

I’ve never really met anyone that doesn’t like a freshly baked cookie, and if anything, since I was a kid it’s just become easier to get pre-made commercial, average, frankly boring cookies. So for me, baking your own is the only way to pass that perfection down the family to the next generation. The problem is, what flavour to choose – there’s so many. Well, I’ve made it easy for you – this, in my view, is the best flavour combo. Bake these, and your face will hurt because you’ll be smiling, chewing and gurning for another one. ”",

      "Once the sugar syrup is clear, turn up the heat, pop in a sugar thermometer and allow the syrup to boil vigorously (please don’t stir it). When it reaches 110°C, place the gelatine pan over a medium heat and stir until dissolved.",
      "Whisk the egg whites in a free-standing electric mixer until you have stiff peaks. Once your syrup has reached 122°C, very carefully and slowly pour it down the sides of the bowl of the moving mixer, then pour in the dissolved gelatine.",
      "Halve the vanilla pods lengthways and scrape out the seeds, add the seeds to the mixer bowl, then continue to whisk for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the mixture has significantly increased in volume, but is thick and still pourable.",
      "You can have a plain white vanilla marshmallow, or you can add any of the flavours listed, to taste (remembering to start small as you can always add more, but you can’t take it away!). Add any natural food colouring at the same time (if using) – I like to try to match the colour of the marshmallow to the flavour I’m using – whisking for a further 2 to 3 minutes to give you a nice even colour and flavour.",
      "Either way, pour the marshmallow mixture into your prepared tray, use a palette knife to smooth it out, then sift over the remaining mixed cornflour and icing sugar and leave somewhere cool for 2 to 3 hours, or until set and soft."

Sieve it into a clean bowl, cover the surface with a layer of clingfilm to stop it forming a skin, and set aside.",

      "To poach the meringues, pour the milk into a wide, shallow saucepan over a medium heat and warm it through until it just begins to simmer. Float 3 or 4 heaped tablespoons of the meringue mixture on the hot milk, making sure they are well spaced out to allow them to expand. Cook for about 30 seconds, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds more, or until they’re firm.",

      "In the 60s and 70s, having a frozen dessert you could serve at a moment’s notice was the posh thing to do. The simple but glorious arctic roll started popping up everywhere, from restaurants to school and hospital menus. Eventually it became seen as something a bit naff and tacky, but I think smearing a home-made sponge with quality jam, good ice cream and a little bashed-up honeycomb is easy, fun, and just a bit silly. Roll it up, freeze it for a few hours, and you’ll get sweet and sour, crunch and softness, all in one mouthful. Heaven.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Move the ice cream to the fridge so it starts to soften. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, add the sugar, and whisk until pale, fluffy and at least doubled in size. You can do this with an electric mixer, or by hand if you’ve got the muscle. Once it’s looking good, sift in the flour and slowly fold it through with a spatula. Grease a baking tray (roughly 26 x 36cm) with butter, then line it with greaseproof paper and grease that too. Spoon half your sponge batter on to the tray, blobbing it about in different places, then sift the cocoa powder into the remaining batter and fold it in.",
      "Spoon the chocolatey sponge into the gaps on the tray, and use the spoon to drag it through the white sponge in S-shapes and circles until it looks beautiful and marbled. Make sure there are no gaps. Place the tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through.",
      "Grease another large sheet of greaseproof paper with butter and sprinkle over a few good pinches of sugar. Take the sponge out of the oven and confidently flip it over on to the paper. Peel and discard the top piece of paper, then, while the sponge is still warm and flexible, loosely roll it up into a long sausage, including the paper, and leave it to cool for around 20 minutes.",
      "Once cooled, gently unroll the sponge and spread over half of the jam. Take big dessert spoons of your soft ice cream and randomly distribute them over the sponge, leaving the last 5 or 6cm at one end free of filling so that it creates a seal when you roll it up. Put whatever you don’t use back in the freezer. Dollop over teaspoons of the remaining jam, then sprinkle your bashed-up chocolate bar all over. Use a spatula to smear everything into a fairly smooth dense layer.",
      "Confidently, start rolling the sponge up again, making sure there's no paper inside it. If the filling starts to slip out, just push it back in. Twisting the ends and squeezing it into a long, fairly even ice-cream sausage. Pop it into the freezer for 3 hours, and take it out around 5 to 10 minutes before you want to use it so it thaws enough to slice. Unwrap your arctic roll, take a slice out of each end to expose the frozen insides, and serve with fresh summer fruits tossed in lemon juice and a pinch of sugar, or any edible flowers if you have them."

Cut your butter up into cubes, add to the processor and pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Tip this mixture into a bowl. If working by hand, pop your pine nuts into a sandwich bag and bash them up with a rolling pin. Tip them into a bowl with the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt, then use a box grater to grate in your chilled butter. Using your fingertips, gently rub the butter into the mix until it starts to resemble fine breadcrumbs. At this point add 2 tablespoons of water to bring everything together, and when you have a firm dough put it to one side.",

Gently mix in and scrape around the edges to make sure nothing is catching, then use a tablespoon to dollop 6 big spoonfuls of dough on top of the peaches. Return the dish to the oven for around 20 minutes. When it’s bubbling, golden on top and nearly perfect, get your ice cream out of\nthe freezer.",
      "Make sure your gang are ready at the table and ready to eat. Dust your cobbler with icing sugar, if using, then spoon a few scoops of ice cream on top and give it a minute to let the ice cream marble into the beautiful peach syrup. Take it to the table and don’t expect much to come back!"

      "It’s a bit retro, but everyone loves a toffee apple from time to time. There’s something strangely exciting about getting all sticky and messy as you eat it. These kebabs are like the strawberry equivalent of a toffee apple. Look for lovely big fruits if you can as they’ll work better. They are messy to eat, but are great fun for a party, and I’ve given you an easy sweet dip recipe to enjoy on the side. Don’t let the kids help you with this one as the caramel gets super hot.",
      "If you can’t get long woody sprigs of rosemary, you can use wooden skewers instead. Strip most of the leaves off of the rosemary sprigs, leaving a 1cm nice tip at the end of each one. Finely chop the leaves from half a sprig, keep the rest for a different recipe. Divide the strawberries between the skewers, lay them on a serving board or platter and put to one side.",
      "Place a pan on a medium heat. Add the sugar and 200ml of water and bring to the boil. Remember that sugar gets really hot and can burn easily so don’t be tempted to touch it. Let the sugar dissolve then leave it to bubble away for 12 to 15 minutes, or until you have a fairly thick syrup. Jiggle the pan occasionally but don’t stir it.",
      "Meanwhile, mix the mascarpone with the remaining teaspoon of caster sugar. Have a taste and a little more if it needs it. Beat it for a few minutes with a wooden spoon, or until it goes really shiny and smooth. Add the limoncello, chopped rosemary and lemon zest, then mix again until well combined and transfer into a little serving bowl for dipping.",
      "Once the caramel is lovely and golden, carefully pour it over the strawberry kebabs, trying to make sure they’re all evenly coated. Again, don’t be tempted to touch as the caramel will still be really hot. Leave the caramel to set then serve the kebabs with the tweaked mascarpone on the side for dipping."

While they’re chilling, slice 4 of the 6 bananas and whiz them up in a food processor with the yoghurt, cinnamon, honey, raisins and rum until smooth. If you have time before you start blending, you can soak the raisins in the rum first to give them a chance to plump up. If not, don’t worry, you can just whiz the rum up with the rest of the ingredients for some extra flavour. (If your bananas are ripe, you won’t need quite as much honey. However, if they are still a little firm, you will need the full 3 tablespoons.)",

      "On the day itself, just before you’re ready to serve the sundaes, grate the chocolate and roughly chop the hazelnuts. Toast the nuts in a dry pan for a few minutes until they are golden. Heat the dulce de leche in a small saucepan until it’s runny and, while it warms up, slice the remaining 2 bananas.",
      "Remove the glasses from the freezer and start with a layer of the thinly sliced banana. Top with a scoop of banana ice cream, drizzle over the runny dulce de leche and finish off with the toasted hazelnuts and grated dark chocolate. Delicious!"

Carefully stir everything in the pan and cook for about 5 minutes or until the apples start to soften and you get a toffee apple vibe happening.

To make it look like a tarte Tatin you need to turn it out, which isn't hard – but you do need to be careful with that hot caramel. So get a serving plate or board larger than your pan and put an oven glove on to protect the arm holding the board. Put the board or plate on top of the pan, then quickly, carefully and confidently turn it out. Put it to one side for a few minutes, so the caramel can cool down, then divide it up and serve with a spoonful of crème fraîche or ice cream."

      "When you halve the peaches, leave the stones in – they will come away a lot more easily after they have been cooked. Put them into a small pan with 4 tablespoons of the sugar, the cinnamon stick and the zest and juice of the orange. Put a lid on top and slowly simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the peach skin and stones can be easily removed. You don't want to cook them to pulp – they should be soft but should still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and put to one side.",
      "In an appropriately sized high-sided, thick-bottomed pan with a lid, slowly melt two-thirds of the butter. Score down the length of the vanilla pods and remove the seeds by scraping a knife down the inside of each half. Add the seeds to the butter and stir. Continue to cook for 1 minute before adding your rice with the remaining sugar. Turn the heat up to medium, stir the rice, and add the wine, continuing to stir until it has almost cooked away. Now add the milk little by little. Keep the rice on a slow but constant simmer for about 16 or 17 minutes and stir it as often as you can. In this way you can massage the starch out of the rice and this will give you a silky, oozy end product, much like the classic Italian risotto. When the rice has cooked through it should be soft yet still holding its shape. You may need to add a little more milk or water just to adjust the consistency. Remove from the heat, add the grated white chocolate and the rest of the butter, then stir, place a lid on top and leave for a few minutes.",
      "Remove the skin and stones from the peaches, discard them along with the cinnamon stick, and take the peaches to the table with your block of dark chocolate, snapped into small pieces. Spoon the risotto on to plates, then push a couple of pieces of dark chocolate into the middle of each one. Just so you know, a perfect risotto should slowly creep and ooze to the side of your plate, so don't worry if it starts to spread out! Gently tear the peaches and place some on each plate, then drizzle over some of the lovely juice and sprinkle over a few mint leaves. By the time you go to eat it, the dark chocolate will have melted. Joy joy joy!"

      "At a fantastic out-of-the-way Mexican restaurant called El Metate in Gallup, New Mexico, the very sweet owner, Rebecca, taught me how to make proper Mexican tamales. To see her teaching me how to make these, watch the video here LINK. Tamales can be sweet, like these, or savoury. They are basically filled Mexican dumplings – I think they’re brilliant. The cornhusks they’re wrapped in are used throughout Mexico. If you buy corn in season it often comes in husks, but the dried husks I’m using here work a treat. You can pick them up online or at Whole Foods Market stores. Otherwise, things like greaseproof or wax paper will also do the trick.",
      "Soak your cornhusks in a bowl of warm water or, if you’re using greaseproof paper, cut yourself 16 pieces roughly 12cm x 20cm. In a separate bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, a pinch of sea salt, baking powder, sugar, coconut and chopped pineapple. Add the lime zest and juice and pour in 200ml of water to bring everything together. Mix well, until you’ve got a thick spoonable paste.",
      "Put a large pan of water on to boil – the pan needs to be big enough to fit a colander on top. Take a soaked cornhusk or piece of greaseproof paper and spoon a heaped tablespoon of your pineapple mixture into the middle of the husk or paper; if the husks are thin you might have to layer two on top of each other. Fold the sides in to cover the filling, then twist the ends and use string to tie them so they look like Christmas crackers.",
      "Lay your prepared tamales in a large colander or steamer, making sure they’re all in one layer and not overlapping. Cover the top of the colander with tin foil and seal it nice and tightly. If you don’t have a colander large enough you can always steam the tamales in 2 batches. Pop the colander on top of your pan of boiling water and steam for about 20 to 25 minutes. About 5 minutes before they’re due to be ready, start making your chocolate sauce.",
      "Gently bring the cream to the boil in a pan on a medium heat. As soon as it starts to boil, take the pan off the heat and stir in your chocolate pieces until they’re perfectly melted and combined. Add the cubes of butter and a pinch of salt and stir well until the butter is melted.",
      "Open one of the tamales to check that it’s perfectly cooked – it should be solid and the wrapping should peel away from it easily. Take them off the heat and let them cool down slightly so they’re cool enough to handle but still warm and delicious. Lay them on a platter next to a jug of your warm chocolate sauce and let everyone get involved and unwrap their own."

      "This is a great dessert that is really tasty. It freshens the palate and you can make it before you need it − it keeps for about four or five days. You can make one large jelly in a tureen mould or dish, or you can do individual ones. Use any combination of fruit, but not pineapple or kiwi fruit, as the jelly won't set if you do.",
      "First of all, decide whether you want to make one big jelly or small individual ones. If you are making a big one, it's a good idea to line the bowl with clingfilm first. Put your ripe fruit into your mould or moulds and refrigerate. Put your gelatine leaves into a bowl with a little cold water to soak for a minute, then drain and add the gelatine back to the bowl with the cordial. Rest above a pan of water over a medium heat and stir constantly until the gelatine and cordial become a syrup. At this point you can add your sugar, stir till dissolved, then remove the bowl from the heat and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or so.",
      "Take your fruit and Prosecco out of the fridge. The idea being that your fruit, moulds and Prosecco are all chilled, so the bubbles stay in the jelly when it sets and they fizz in your mouth when you eat it - beautiful! Pour the Prosecco into your cordial mix, and then pour this over your fruit. Some of the fruit might rise to the top, so using your finger, just push the fruit down into the jelly mix so that it is sealed and will then keep well in the fridge. Put back into the fridge for an hour to set.",
      "To serve, dip your mould into a bowl of hot water to loosen the outside of the jelly, then turn it out on to a plate. Great served with a little crème fraîche but just as good on its own."

      "Smush-ins are one of the coolest sweet treats to make. I remember when I was a kid, me and my sister would always try to defrost our hard ice-cream in our dessert bowls into almost a thick milkshakey consistency before scoffing the lot. Then as we matured we realised that many flavours could be mushed in to improve the flavour of the rubbishy ice-cream that our parents always used to give us.",
      "So, from the word ‘mush’ and the phrase ‘mushing it in’ they became ‘smush-ins’. It was great going round the supermarkets as a kid secretly slipping possible smush-ins into the trolley. Anything could be a contender – from maple syrup to bashed up chocolate bits, meringue, fruit – you name it, we would smush it! Winegums aren't so good though. But melted chocolate caramel bars are choooooooice.",
      "All you need to do is get a big pot of vanilla ice-cream and a selection of possible smush-ins. Take 2 large scoops of ice-cream per person, blob these on to a clean chopping board, sprinkle or dribble over your flavours and then, with a spatula or fork, mush and smush them together. Scoop up and lob into a bowl or cornet.",
      "Give these a bash and make an event of them when you've got all the kids round. They're really good fun and great to use as bribes to get the kids helping you with the proper cooking! Smush away."

Beat the eggs and a pinch of sea salt in a large bowl, then add the cardamom, sugar, melted butter, 500g of the flour and the milk and yeast mixture. Whisk constantly as you add everything so you end up with quite a thick, gluey consistency. Mix in the remaining 300g of flour until you have a dough. Use clean floured hands to bring the dough together, then dust the top with flour. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size and is full of air pockets.",
      "Meanwhile, put the blueberries and caster sugar into a bowl. Finely grate the orange zest and add most of it to the bowl, along with a good squeeze of orange juice, then mash together with a potato masher. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper, then dot the paper with a few knobs of the butter and sprinkle over half the demerara sugar.",
      "Dust a clean surface and your hands with flour and gently stretch and pull the risen dough out until it’s a bit bigger than an A4 piece of paper. This next bit is pretty messy, so have a bowl of flour on hand to help you handle the dough and don’t be alarmed if it seems quite wet. Use a slotted spoon to move half the mashed blueberries on to the dough. Try not to include too much juice. Use the back of the spoon to spread the blueberries around the dough. Pull the sides of the dough up and into the middle like an envelope, and keep turning and pushing the dough together.",
      "Cut the dough into 8 equal portions, then pull and stretch each one into a long, thin sausage shape, twisting them around on themselves so you get a sort of rough knot. Arrange them on the tray, leaving enough room between for them to spread as they cook. Push your fingers into the top of each one to make a little well, then spoon in a few of the remaining mashed berries and gently push them down. Spoon over a little of the blueberry juice from the bowl, then sprinkle with the rest of your demerara and the reserved orange zest. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for about 20 minutes in a warm place.",
      "Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Once the buns have risen, put them into the oven and cook for 25 minutes, until golden and crispy. Serve them, hot and delicious, by themselves or with warm custard."

It's one of those combinations that just explodes in your mouth and you can't get enough of it. Once you try it, you'll never forget it.",

Cut both ends off and peel the skin with a knife, removing any little black bits. Then cut the pineapple into quarters and remove the slightly less tasty core, which I usually discard or suck on while preparing the rest of the dish. Finely slice your quarters, lengthways, as thin as you can. Lay out flat in one or two layers on a large plate. Don't refrigerate this – just put it to one side.",

Your family or guests will probably think you've gone mad, especially if you ignore them while you do this, but pick the mint leaves and add them to the sugar. Bash the hell out of it in the pestle and mortar at the table. You'll see the sugar change colour and it will smell fantastic. It normally takes about a minute to do if you've got a good wrist action. Sprinkle the mint sugar over the plate of pineapple – making sure you don't let anyone nick any pineapple before you sprinkle the sugar over. What a fantastic thing. If you have any leftovers, you could always make a piña colada with them."

Throw in your thyme, secured together in a little bunch with string. Bring to the boil, turn down to a simmer, and add your pears, sitting upright. Put the lid on the pan and bake in the preheated oven for around 1 hour until the pears are soft and tender but not falling apart. They should be soft all the way through but retain their shape. (Sometimes they can take less or more time depending on the ripeness of the pears.) When they're ready they will have taken on the flavour and colour of the wine and should smell delicious.",
      "By now the wine and the sugar will have thickened and the flavour will have intensified. Remove the pears to a dish, turn up the heat under the pan, and reduce the wine by about half. Remove from the heat and add the butter – agitate the pan but don't give it any more heat. This will give you a really intense, tasty sauce which is to die for. Put the pears back in the pan and leave until ready to serve. Warm is the best temperature to serve this dish, and it’s best with some nice whipped sour cream or crème fraîche – a lovely contrast to the richness of the sauce."

      "Sorbets are always a nice way to finish a meal if you don’t want anything too heavy. They can also be used as palate cleansers between courses. Either way, a sorbet is pretty much always made the same way – a fruit purée is mixed with a little stock syrup in the right quantity to make it freeze. It will become really shiny and soft to scoop.",
      "This particular recipe for pear and grappa sorbet is a wicked combo and one of my favourites, so give it a bash. It’s great served in a bowl with lovely soft fruits scattered over the top. A good-quality vodka instead of grappa would be quite interesting and, without wanting to sound like a nutcase, absinthe would be nice too, but to be honest most good supermarkets and off-licences sell grappa these days. Nardini is a particularly good brand.",
      "This recipe will make enough for 6 people to have a couple of scoops each, but for 4 you can make this amount and keep the rest in the freezer for another day. I suggest you use a fairly shallow earthenware or thick porcelain dish that you can put in the freezer beforehand – this speeds up the freezing process for the sorbet.",
      "Try to get really ripe pears – even the ones they sell cheaply in the market. If they’re really really ripe and soft to the touch, simply remove the skin and put the flesh into a bowl – you won’t need to cook them at all. This is how I did it in Italy when the fruit guy called Pippo at the weekly Terranuova Bracciolini market near Montevarchi gave me a whole tray of pears for free. Go and say hello and he might do the same for you!",
      "First of all put the sugar and water into a pan on the hob. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Add your quartered pears and, unless they’re super soft, continue to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, leave to one side for 5 minutes, then add the lemon juice (minus the pips) and zest. Pour everything into a food processor and whiz to a purée, then push the mixture through a coarse sieve into the dish in which you want to serve it.",
      "Add the grappa, give it a good stir, and taste. The grappa shouldn’t be overbearing or too powerful – it should be subtle and should work well with the pears. However, different brands do vary in strength and flavour, so add to taste. (This isn’t an excuse to add the whole bottle, though, because if you use too much alcohol the sorbet won’t freeze.) Put the dish into the freezer and whisk it up with a fork every half-hour – you’ll see it becoming pale in colour. After a couple of hours it will be ready. The texture should be nice and scoopable. Delicious served with ventagli or other delicate crunchy biscuits.",
      "PS This sorbet will last in the freezer for a couple of days – after that it will crystallize."

Using your hands, work the cubes of butter into the flour and sugar by rubbing your thumbs against your fingers until you end up with a fine, crumbly mixture. This is the point where you can spike the mixture with interesting flavours, so mix in your lemon zest.",
      "Add the eggs and milk to the mixture and gently work it together till you have a ball of dough. Flour it lightly. Don’t work the pastry too much at this stage or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short. Flour your work surface and place the dough on top. Pat it into a flat round, flour it lightly, wrap it in clingfilm and put it into the fridge to rest for at least half an hour."

Fold in your ground almonds, poppy seeds, the lemon zest and juice and the sifted flour. Spoon the mix into the prepared cake tin and bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes or until lightly golden. You can check to see if the cake is cooked by poking a cocktail stick right into the sponge. Remove it after 5 seconds and if it comes out clean the cake is cooked; if slightly sticky it needs a little longer, so put it back in the oven. Allow the cake to cool on a rack.",

When your cake is almost cool, put it on a serving plate and pour the icing carefully over the top. If you pour it on to the middle of the cake, then let gravity disperse the icing down the sides, you get the ‘drizzle’ effect! Give it a helping hand with a spoon if you want."

The nice thing about them was that they weren’t full of a thousand E numbers because I would make them out of apple juice, orange juice, lemonade, pineapple juice – all sorts of stuff. Even cocktail combinations are good. I would also sneak into the pub for some cider shandy to make lolly pops!",
      "All you need to do to make lolly pops is buy a couple of those really cheap ice lolly sets. You can find them in most kitchen shops.

      "You should have no problem getting nice figs at Christmas time and they’re wonderful to make in so many ways so when you see them, buy them up! Here’s one really gorgeous way to have them. I promise you won’t get bored of these; there are so many lovely ways of using them up.",
      "Personally, I like to make a sort of bruschetta with them or put them out on a platter with some nice cheese. As it’s Christmas and your kitchen is probably well-stocked, you’ll hopefully have the ingredients for the bruschetta on hand already. If not, you can always improvise with whatever you’ve got in the fridge.",
      "Preheat your oven to 110ºC/225ºF/gas ¼. Lay your figs, cut-side up, in a baking tray. Using a fine grater, zest your clementines over the figs then dust the figs with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a teaspoon of sugar. My flavoured sugar is also great for this so if you’ve made a batch of that, feel free to use that instead.",
      "Pop the figs in the oven to bake for 4 hours, checking on them every hour or so. When they come out of the oven you’ll have semi-dehydrated figs, which will be a bit like wine gums.",
      "Fig bruschetta\nGet yourself a few slices of nice warm bread, crumble over some lumps of cheese, and a few pieces of walnut then put a few fig halves and a drizzle of runny honey over the top to finish it off. I think the combination of salty goat’s cheese with these figs and a bit of honey is absolute heaven.",
      "Figs in honey\nYou’ll be able to put any leftover figs to good use in all sorts of ways. A really nice way of using them at Christmas is to turn them into a bit of a gift by popping a stack of them in a sterilised jar, covering them completely with honey then sealing the jar with an airtight lid. They’ll be beautiful as part of a cheese platter, baked in a tart, a sticky toffee pud, or even thrown into a roasting tray with some pork or other meat for a bit of added sweetness. Give them to your mates when you go round to theirs for dinner. They’ll love getting something unique, especially when you explain all the different things they can do with them."

      "Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Butter a 28cm/11 inch loose-bottomed flan tin or cheesecake mould, line it with greaseproof paper and place it in the fridge. Put the hazelnuts on to a baking tray and roast in the oven for about 5 minutes until lightly golden. Allow to cool, then whiz up in a food processor until you have a fine powder — be careful not to over-whiz. You can bash the nuts up in a tea towel using a rolling pin if you don’t have a food processor. Beat the butter and sugar together either in the food processor, or in a bowl with a whisk, until pale. Add the egg yolks one by one, and the orange zest. Sieve in the flour, crumble in the ricotta and stir in the powdered hazelnuts and the poppy seeds. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are really stiff, then fold them slowly into the hazelnut mixture. Pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake in the preheated oven for around 25-30 minutes until there is a little colour on the top of the torte. You can check to see that it’s ready by sticking a cocktail stick into the centre of the torte. It should come out clean and not sticky.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow to cool. While it’s cooling, place the jam in a little pan with 4 tablespoons of water and bring this slowly up to the boil. Brush this over the top of the torte and, when cool, sprinkle with the grated chocolate. Serve with some crème fraîche or fromage frais."

In a third bowl, beat the cream until slightly thick and just whipped.",

Finish by tipping in the egg whites, then keep folding, from the outside in in a figure-of-eight until the mix is smooth and evenly coloured. It will look a bit dodgy at first, but trust me it will come together. Spoon or ladle the mousse into a big serving bowl or divide between little glasses or cappuccino cups and pop in the fridge for an hour or two until set.",
      "Just before you’re ready to serve, give the mousse a lovely dusting of cocoa. Pop your dried cherries in a small pan, add a wineglass of amaretto then top with enough water to cover. Put on the heat and bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to stand for a bit. This will bring the cherries back to life. Leaving them in the packet, bash up your sesame snaps in a pestle and mortar. Tip them out, and break up any larger bits that are left so its nutty with a caramelly kick and a bit of a crunch. Serve this in the mortar next to your chocolate mousse with a bowl of those beautiful cherries on the side so everyone can dig in and help themselves. It may look a bit rustic, but honestly, it’s the best chocolate mousse I’ve ever tasted!"

      "This is a superb moist cake, a bit like a clafoutis in France, but by adding breadcrumbs and using polenta it becomes very much like an Italian bread and butter pudding. It’s something that Italians would cook in the embers of the fire after dinner.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and butter a shallow 28cm loose-bottomed cake tin. Mix the polenta, flour, breadcrumbs and sugar in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the milk, eggs, honey and olive oil. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture, making sure you stir it all together well. Add the figs, raisins, apples, cinnamon, orange and lemon zest and salt, and stir again.",
      "Pour the mixture into your cake tin and bake for about 50 minutes. Keep an eye on it – you may need to cover it with some foil if you find that it starts to brown too much at the edges. Before serving, sprinkle over some caster sugar. Then make sure you eat it warm – lovely with a dollop of crème fraîche and a glass of vin santo!"

      "Even though it has a strong British heritage, America has embraced the apple pie to the point that it’s now considered a quintessentially American dessert. American pies often look like the ones from those Desperate Dan comics – big, robust and full of attitude. The crumble-like topping sprinkled over my pie is an idea I’ve been playing about with, and I think it helps make it unique. Because huckleberries grow wild in Wyoming, I felt it was only right to use them, but feel free to use fresh or frozen blueberries in their place for equally delicious results. Assembling your pie is dead easy, and I’ll talk you through it step by step, but if you’d like to see how it’s done before you start, check out the How to video for a demonstration.",
      "You can make your pastry by hand, or simply pulse all the ingredients in a food processor. If making by hand, sieve the flour, icing sugar and a pinch of sea salt from a height into a large mixing bowl. Use your fingertips to gently work the cubes of butter into the flour and sugar until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Transfer a handful of this mixture to a separate bowl, rub it between your fingers to get larger crumbs, then put aside. Add the eggs and milk to the main mixture and gently work it together until you have a ball of pastry dough. Don’t work it too much at this stage – you want to keep it crumbly and short. Sprinkle a little flour over the pastry, then wrap it in cling film and pop it into the fridge to rest for 1 hour.",
      "Meanwhile, put the apples into a large pan with the zest and juice of 1 orange, a splash of water and 5 tablespoons of caster sugar. Cover the pan and simmer on a medium heat for 10 minutes, until the apples have softened but still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Scrunch a handful of berries in a bowl with the remaining caster sugar and the zest and juice of your remaining orange. Add the rest of the berries. Toss the cooled apples and their juices in a large bowl with the berries and the flour, then put aside.",
      "Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Take your ball of pastry out of the fridge and let it come up to room temperature. Get yourself a pie dish around 28cm in diameter. Flour a clean surface and a rolling pin. Cut off a third of your pastry and put that piece to one side. Roll the rest into a circle just over 0.5cm thick, dusting with flour as you go. Roll the circle of pastry up over your rolling pin, then gently unroll it over the pie dish. Push it into the sides, letting any excess pastry hang over the edge. Tip in the fruit filling and brush all around the edge of the pastry with some of the beaten egg. Roll out the smaller ball of pastry about 0.5cm thick and use your rolling pin to lay it over the top of the pie. Brush it all over with more beaten egg, reserving a little. Sprinkle over the reserved crumble mixture and the demerara sugar.",
      "Fold the scruffy edges of pastry hanging over the sides back over the pie, sealing the edge by twisting or crimping it as you like. Brush these folded edges with your remaining beaten egg. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a cross into the middle of the pie. Place on the bottom of the oven and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until golden and beautiful. Serve with ice cream, cream or custard."
