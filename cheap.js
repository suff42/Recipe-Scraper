Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you’ll scramble the eggs.)",

      "If you’ve managed to get any courgette flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long.",

If I’m short of time, I’ll keep this simple and empty the beans straight into a sturdy 20cm x 30cm baking tray, so they make a flat layer across the bottom, but, to take it a step further, pimp them up first. Finely slice the onion, garlic, peppers and chilli (I leave the seeds in, but deseed if you prefer). Heat a splash of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then add the chopped veg and thyme leaves and fry for around 8 minutes, or until softened. Dice the tomatoes and add to the pan for another 5 minutes or so, or until jammy and reduced. Pour in the beans and simmer for a final 5 minutes, then season to how you like it and pour into the baking tray in a flat layer.",
      "To make the cheesy mash, quarter the potatoes, halving any smaller ones, then put into a pan of boiling salted water. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain in a colander, then return the empty pan to a low heat, place the colander on top and allow the potatoes to steam dry for a couple of minutes. Tip out any excess liquid from the pan, then tip in the potatoes, add the butter and about 75ml of milk. Mash well until light, fluffy and smooth, adding a splash more milk if needed. Stir in a few gratings of nutmeg, grate in one-third of the cheese and season to how you like it.",
      "Layer the cheesy mash on top of the beans, carefully spreading it out to the edges in an even layer, then grate over the remaining cheese (I prefer mature Cheddar, but mild is fine too). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the beans are hot through, the cheese is melted and golden, and it's bubbling at the edges. Serve with a crisp green salad and homemade coleslaw. This is my fail-safe go-to dish if I’m in need of a bit of naughty comfort food.",

      "To make the pizza dough, place the flour on a clean work surface or in a large bowl, make a well in the middle, then gradually pour in 750ml of lukewarm water, followed by the yeast, sugar, a pinch of salt and a lug of olive oil. Use a fork to mix in the flour from the sides, then bring it together with your hands to form a slightly sticky dough. Knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for around 5 minutes, or until soft and springy, then place in a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for around 1 hour, or until doubled in size.",
      "Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pan. Finely chop and add the garlic, tear in the basil leaves and add the plum tomatoes, then cook for 5 minutes, or until smelling and tasting fantastic. Using a hand blender, blitz the sauce until smooth, then season with salt and pepper and set aside.",
      "Bash the fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, then add to a medium frying pan over a medium heat with a splash of olive oil, the pork mince and rosemary leaves. Fry for around 5 minutes, or until cooked through and crisp, stirring occasionally.",
      "Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7. Place a pizza stone in the oven to preheat. Divide the risen dough into 10 equal-sized balls, then roll out on a flour-dusted surface to roughly ½cm thick and 25cm in diameter. Grate and sprinkle over equal amounts of the mozzarella, making sure to leave a rough 2cm gap around the edges, then drizzle about 5 tablespoons of tomato sauce onto each – by adding the cheese first and the tomato second, you’ll stop the base from getting soggy.",
      "Scatter over the fennel-spiked pork, then finely slice and sprinkle over the chillies. Drizzle with olive oil, then carefully remove the pizza stone from the oven and place a few pizzas on top, depending on how many you can fit (you’ll need to do this in batches). Pop in the hot oven for around 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, slice up and serve as you go.",

      "Jam tarts are definitely a part of my childhood. They are humble, cheap to make and such a pretty little treat. It’s funny how simple pastry with a blob of jam can turn into something so exciting, with chewy bits, bubbling bits, crunchy bits and jammy jelly bits. Even if you cheat a little, and buy ready-made pastry, just the ritual of filling these tarts with your favourite jams and then baking them can be really relaxing. The beauty of these for me is playing with the different jam or jelly flavours so you get a rainbow of colours. Just about every supermarket in Britain stocks a great selection of posh jams: strawberry, blackberry, blueberry, gooseberry, apricot, cranberry ... the sheer number of fillings available now makes these even more exciting than the ones I had as a kid.",
      "Put the flour, sugar and butter into a food processor with a pinch of sea salt and pulse until you have a mixture that looks like breadcrumbs. Crack in the egg, grate in the zest from your orange or lemon and pulse again, adding a little splash of milk to bring everything together, if needed. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and pop it into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out the pastry so it’s 0.5cm thick. Get yourself a few 12-hole jam tart trays (or cook the tarts in batches) and a fluted pastry cutter just a little bigger than the holes of the tray (normally around 6cm). Cut out rounds of pastry and gently push them into the wells so they come up the sides. Any leftover pastry can be gently pushed back into a ball and rolled out to make a few more tarts. Put 1 heaped teaspoon of filling into each jam tart, interspersing and alternating the flavours of jams, curds or jellies.",
      "Pop the trays on the middle shelf of the oven and cook for around 12 to 15 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the filling is thick and bubbling. Remove from the oven, leave in the tray to firm slightly, then transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool for a few minutes before serving.",

      "1 heaped tablespoon plain flour",

    instructions: [
      "Rhys Pendergast made a really kind donation to Help a Capital Child this year, so I’m dedicating this dish to him, in celebration of his wedding to the lovely Katie. I’m told Rhys makes a mean toad-in-the-hole, and I hope they enjoy this version for years to come. In Yorkshire, I learned how real Yorkshire folk approach making a great Yorkie. They aren’t into making their batter the night before, instead they focus on getting plenty of air into the batter and achieving a hot consistent temperature in the oven. I truly love this great classic and have only ever had one issue with it: quite often, you end up with half a sausage (the toad) poking out of the Yorkshire (the hole). The bit sticking out is crispy and golden – good times – but the other half of the sausage, inside the batter, is soft, anaemic and boiled – bad times. So in the spirit of family-style sharing and creating a dish that makes everyone go ‘Oooh!’ I’m separating out the elements so you end up with amazing crispy sausages, a tray of giant Yorkshire to tear up and a wonderful onion and apple gravy. Heaven.",
      "Whisk the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then pour into a jug. Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Cut your onions into 1cm thick slices, and do the same with the apples – removing the core. Put a large pan on a medium heat. Add the butter, a lug of olive oil, the onions and the apples. Pick in the leaves from 2 sprigs of rosemary. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Remove the sauce from the heat once soft, season, and add the honey and a splash of water, if needed. Put the sausages into a sturdy roasting tray (roughly 30 x 40cm), toss with a little olive oil and cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden.",
      "Transfer the cooked sausages to a pretty ovenproof dish and toss with half the apple and onion sauce. Cover with tin foil. Remove any excess fat from the roasting tray, replace with a good lug of olive oil and place on a medium heat. Add the remaining rosemary leaves and after 30 seconds, pour in the batter, then put straight into the middle of the oven with the sausages on the shelf underneath. Cook for around 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pudding is fluffy, golden and puffing up at the sides. Whatever you do, do not open the oven door.",
      "Put the pan of apples and onions back on a high heat and stir in the flour. Be brave; let it get really golden before adding the cider, stock and a couple of really good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Let it boil and bubble away until thickened to your liking. Get your guests to the table, with their knives and forks in their hands. Put the bubbling gravy on a board in the middle of the table.",
      "Remove and uncover your sizzling sausages, then slide your Yorkshire pudding on to a nice board. This lovely dish definitely needs balancing, so serve with something green and fresh, like runner beans, greens, salad or dressed chard.",

    description:
      "“I completely fell in love with Welsh cakes after Jim gave me my first taste of one in Pontypridd market. The Welsh cooks of old did a lot of cooking on bakestones, which are essentially round cast iron skillets. They'd place them over a fire in their home, and use them for things like these sweet little cakes, which have a crisp outside and a soft, slightly crumbly inside that is to die for. You can replicate that bakestone style of cooking using a heavy-bottomed non-stick pan. I love serving these warm as they are or filled with a spoonful of cream and a few berries. Jim was using chunks of chocolate, different dried fruits and even sprinkles of desiccated coconut, so feel free to experiment once you’ve mastered the basic recipe. ”",

      "To test the temperature, cook one Welsh cake in the pan for a few minutes to act as a thermometer. If the surface is blonde, turn the heat up a little; if it’s black, turn the heat down – leave for a few minutes for the heat to correct itself, then try again. When you've got a golden cake after 4 minutes on each side, you're in a really good place and you can cook the rest in batches. It’s all about control.",
      "As soon as they come off the pan, put them on a wire rack to cool and sprinkle them with caster sugar. You can serve them just like this, as they are. Or, if you want to do what I've done, gently cut each cake in half while turning so you get a top and a bottom.",
      "Whip the cream, sugar and vanilla paste together until you have soft peaks. Put the berries into a bowl, slicing up any big ones, and toss them with the juice of 1 lemon and a sprinkling of sugar. Open the cakes up, and add a little dollop of cream and a few berries to each one.",

Add these to the bowl with the leaves of a few sprigs of fresh thyme, a good lug of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and a small swig of white wine and toss together. Place your leek and flavourings from the bowl into the tray, then wrap the chicken breast in 4 slices of pancetta. This will not only flavour the chicken but also protect it while it cooks. Try and bend the sides of the tray in towards the chicken so the leeks don't burn during cooking. Drizzle with olive oil, place a couple of whole thyme sprigs on top and cook in the middle of the oven for 25 to 35 minutes.",

Add your onions, garlic, peppers and chillies, stir everything together, then fry for 15 minutes on a high heat until any liquid from the pork has evaporated and everything is starting to turn golden. When it looks good, stir in your chopped tomatoes and half a glass of water.

    instructions: [
      "Stage 1: making a well\nPile the flour on to a clean surface and make a large well in the centre. Pour half your water into the well, then add your yeast, sugar and salt and stir with a fork.",
      "Stage 2: getting it together\nSlowly, but confidently, bring in the flour from the inside of the well. (You don't want to break the walls of the well, or the water will go everywhere.) Continue to bring the flour in to the centre until you get a stodgy, porridgey consistency – then add the remaining water. Continue to mix until it's stodgy again, then you can be more aggressive, bringing in all the flour, making the mix less sticky. Flour your hands and pat and push the dough together with all the remaining flour. (Certain flours need a little more or less water, so feel free to adjust.)",
      "Stage 3: kneading!\nThis is where you get stuck in. With a bit of elbow grease, simply push, fold, slap and roll the dough around, over and over, for 4 or 5 minutes until you have a silky and elastic dough.",
      "Stage 4: first prove\nFlour the top of your dough. Put it in a bowl, cover with cling film, and allow it to prove for about half an hour until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, moist, draught-free place. This will improve the flavour and texture of your dough and it's always exciting to know that the old yeast has kicked into action.",
      "Stage 5: second prove, flavouring and shaping\nOnce the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out for 30 seconds by bashing it and squashing it. You can now shape it or flavour it as required – folded, filled, tray-baked, whatever – and leave it to prove for a second time for 30 minutes to an hour until it has doubled in size once more. This is the most important part, as the second prove will give it the air that finally ends up being cooked into your bread, giving you the really light, soft texture that we all love in fresh bread. So remember – don't fiddle with it, just let it do its thing.",
      "Stage 6: cooking your bread\nPreheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Very gently place your bread dough on to a flour-dusted baking tray and into the preheated oven. Don't slam the door or you'll lose the air that you need. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked and golden brown. You can tell if it's cooked by tapping its bottom – if it sounds hollow it's done, if it doesn't then pop it back in for a little longer. Once cooked, place on a rack and allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes – fandabidozi. Feel free to freeze any leftover bread.",
