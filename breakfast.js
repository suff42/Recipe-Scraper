    instructions: [
      "Position racks in the centre and bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.",
      "Rinse the shiitake caps and dry them thoroughly in a salad spinner or pat them dry with a paper towel. Cut the caps into ¼-inch-thick slices (the goal here is to have similar-size pieces so that they cook evenly). Transfer them to a large bowl.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut oil, tamari, ½ cup of the nutritional yeast, and the liquid smoke. Pour this mixture over the sliced shiitakes. Delicately toss them until all the pieces are coated. Divide the mushrooms evenly onto the baking sheets, arranging them into a single layer.",
      "Sprinkle the remaining ½ teaspoon nutritional yeast on top of the shiitakes and coat the tops with a healthy amount of cooking oil spray. (The goal here is to basically oven-fry the shiitakes, so please don’t hold back—this isn’t a low-fat recipe. We are replicating bacon, people.)",
      "Place the sheets in the oven, one in the centre, one on the bottom. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and toss with a thin spatula. Spread the mushrooms back out evenly and coat them again with a good amount of cooking oil spray, and another dusting of nutritional yeast. Return the trays to the oven, switching racks. Bake until the mushrooms become crispy on the edges, about 15 minutes (less if you think they might burn). Remove from the oven.",
      "At this point you could make or break the bacon. And because each oven is different, you have to play with it yourself. What you are trying to do is push the mushrooms to their crispiest point without burning them. As my mother would say, you must “Watch them like a hawk!” Coat the mushrooms once more with some cooking oil spray and return to the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes. Taste one. If it is still not crispy, bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. If you are scared to keep pushing it, try only baking a few to see how far you can take them. This way you won’t burn the whole batch.",
      "One baking sheet may be done before the other; just remove them at separate times. Some pieces may also be stubborn and take longer than others. It’s okay if a few pieces are chewier than others. Like the recipe implies, making shiitake bacon is an art. It takes practice to perfect this exquisite food.",

Only once in a while of course. But seriously, without trying to sound like a lagered-up geezer, I think everyone’s experienced the need for food around midnight, whether the binge was small or large, otherwise why would kebab shops be so popular in Britain? Anyway, I always used to have three or four friends back to my house for munchies or to stay the night and this dish was devised so we didn’t have too much trouble making it or too much washing up to do. In actual fact, I only had to wipe the non-stick pan clean. It also makes its way from the pan to the plate quite quickly, as patience isn’t a virtue at that time of night with my mates! ”",

You can make porridge using 50g of granola dust to 200ml of milk, then top with fresh fruit, and this ratio also works for a smoothie – I like to chuck 1 ripe banana and 1 handful of frozen raspberries into the mix too. It’s even a great base for pancakes – simply beat 2 heaped tablespoons of granola dust with 1 heaped tablespoon of wholemeal self-raising flour, 1 mashed banana and 1 large free-range egg, then cook as normal. And in winter, try a hot drink – heat 25g of granola dust with 200ml of your favourite milk to your desired consistency.",

      "Me and my dear friend Pete Begg have two very different approaches to the institution that is the perfect bacon sarnie. The only thing we agree on is that bacon ain't bacon unless it’s smoked, but that’s pretty much where the similarities end.",
      "We do both use two 1½cm-thick slices of simple standard white crusty loaf, but I favour a bloomer and Pete tends to go for a tin loaf. Pete’s a 3 rashers of streaky-bacon boy; I’m a back-bacon boy. He cooks it in a frying pan, starting out from cold with a little drizzle of olive oil and gradually bringing the temperature up to medium-high so the fat renders out, placing something flat and heavy on top to ensure super-even crispy bacon. I, on the other hand, put the grill on full whack, rub a tray and 3 rashers of back bacon with olive oil, then blast it until golden and crisp, which encourages the fat end of the bacon to curl up, creating a little pond of delicious bacon juice in the middle.",
      "Pete butters his bread, then lays the bacon on side-by-side, like floorboards. I skip the butter, but push the bacon to the side of my tray and lay the bread in the fat for a few seconds before assembling, letting the bacon rashers sit on the bed of bread like spooning lovers. At this point, Pete goes into another gear and displays a little trick his dad taught him as a boy, sandwiching his creation together and placing it back in the pan of smoky bacon fat to lightly toast on both sides, again with a little weight on top. And it doesn’t finish there – Pete stipulates that if the bacon runs north to south it must be cut east to west into 3 thin sandwiches, so you get 3 bacon soldiers in each, from which he gets 3 perfect bites. Genius. I simply cut mine diagonally from corner to corner and get it in my gob as quickly as possible .",
      "Having been brought up in Essex I have a loyal commitment to HP sauce, but Pete pulls yet another trick out of the bag, treating his plate like an artist’s palette with 60% ketchup, 30% English mustard and 10% green chilli sauce, feathered together with a knife, to ensure 9 erratic, beautiful-tasting mouthfuls. Wow.",
      "These two sandwiches are both delicious, but most importantly, this is how I like mine and Pete likes his. How do you like yours?",

      "Crumpies are my new delicious invention and are a cross between a crumpet and a Yorkshire pudding. They can be whizzed together quickly, then poured into a Yorkshire pudding mould and banged into the oven to get lovely and crisp on the top and bottom, and knotty, chewy and bubbly inside. They’re perfect with butter, or whatever other lovely condiments you’ve got hanging around the cupboard. My wife loves strawberry jam with hers, Daisy loves Marmite, Poppy loves a drizzle of honey, and personally I like a little scrambled egg with a blob of ketchup or brown sauce (or both) on the plate and, depending on how I feel, a little chilli sauce.",
      "Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and grease a 12-hole muffin tin with some vegetable oil. Place all the other ingredients in a bowl with 2 teaspoons of sea salt and pour in 600ml of tepid water. The water needs to be warm enough to activate the yeast, but not so hot that it kills it.",
      "Whisk everything together until you’ve got a loose batter that is just combined – this should only take a few seconds. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to let the yeast do its job. When the mixture is a spoonable, sticky consistency, but still quite wet, spoon it into the muffin tin. Fill each hole until it’s almost level with the top of the tin and cook for around 35 minutes, or until the crumpies are risen and golden. Remove to a wire rack for a few minutes to cool slightly, then serve while still warm with anything you fancy.",

      "During a stay in Glasgow I was introduced to these incredible potato scones. I didn’t grow up eating these, but they’re beautiful and so easy. A bit like bubble without the squeak. This was my first attempt at mastering them and it turned into this lovely breakfast, which I made in a pretty little flat in Glasgow’s West End. It’s the posh area of town and is full of beautiful shops and neighbourhoods. Well worth a visit.\nThis dish is the best brunch I can think of, besides maybe kedgeree. I never would have thought of putting this much flour with potatoes, but it works brilliantly. Give them a go with bangers, stews, on their own, or as part of this lovely brunch…I assure you this is one of the nicest ways to start the day, ever.",
      "Cut the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks and cook them in boiling salted water for around 7 minutes, or until tender. Drain them, allow them to cool, then return them to the empty pan and add the flour. Lightly mash everything together but try to avoid stirring it up too much. Finely slice the chives and add them to the potatoes with a knob of butter and the baking powder, then mash a few more times. (If you like, you can grate a little cheese into the mixture at this point – it’s delicious.) Season, then use your clean hands to bring the mixture together. Pinch off a little, taste and adjust the seasoning, then divide into 4 balls and dust with flour.",
      "Put a large frying pan (roughly 32cm) on a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the potato balls (you may need to cook them in batches) and pat them down so they’re almost flat – 2cm thick is about right. Cook for around 10 minutes, turning them every few minutes until golden on both sides.",
      "Meanwhile, beat the eggs so they are broken and marbled. Season and put aside. When your potato scones are perfectly cooked, divide them between your plates, then take the pan off the heat and add a knob of butter. Once bubbling, pour in the eggs and put back on a low heat. Don’t be tempted to stir aggressively, use a rubber spatula to just sweep up the cooked layer of egg from the bottom of the pan every time it forms, so the uncooked egg can get down there and set. This will give you the nicest texture. The key to good scrambled egg is getting the perfect ratio of cooked silky egg and slightly less-cooked curds. To achieve that, you need to remove it from the heat once it looks three-quarters cooked – trust me. It will carry on cooking and by the time you mix it around one more time and serve, it will be gold.",
      "Arrange a piece of smoked salmon on top and add a pinch of watercress. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and serve with wedges of lemon for squeezing over.",
