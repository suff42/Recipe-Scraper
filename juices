You can make porridge using 50g of granola dust to 200ml of milk, then top with fresh fruit, and this ratio also works for a smoothie – I like to chuck 1 ripe banana and 1 handful of frozen raspberries into the mix too. It’s even a great base for pancakes – simply beat 2 heaped tablespoons of granola dust with 1 heaped tablespoon of wholemeal self-raising flour, 1 mashed banana and 1 large free-range egg, then cook as normal. And in winter, try a hot drink – heat 25g of granola dust with 200ml of your favourite milk to your desired consistency."
