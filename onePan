      "First up, if you’re jointing the chicken yourself, break the knuckles and chop them off with a sharp knife, through the joint.",
      "Pull out the wings and cut them off at the base, cutting slightly into the breast so you get a generous meaty portion. Lightly cut through the skin between the chicken leg and breast, so that the leg falls to the side.",

      "Find the joint in between the drumstick and thigh, tap the heel of the knife and cut through the bone, separating the drumstick and thigh, then repeat.",
      "Leaving the breasts on the bone, carefully cut between the breasts and backbone to separate the front and back of the bird.",
      "Slice between the breasts on the bone to separate, then use the heel of the knife to cut across each breast through the bone, leaving you with two large chunks, then slice each chunk into four pieces. Season the chicken with sea salt, black pepper and 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds. Pop the carcass in a bag and put in the freezer for tasty cooking another day – it makes an amazing stock.",
      "Put a large non-stick pan on a medium-high heat with 50g of butter. Add the chicken wings, legs and thighs skin-side down to brown in the pan for around 3½ minutes, or until golden all over, turning occasionally. Once the butter is dark brown and almost burnt, transfer the chicken to a plate and throw away the oil and butter left in the pan. This will leave you with tasty sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan, which will give you a lovely caramelly flavour later on.",
      "Return your chicken to the pan with another 50g of butter, and repeat the process, turning the chicken for another 3½ minutes, or until the butter is dark brown, then throwing away the almost burnt butter.",
      "Go in with the breast meat and another 50g of butter, and return the browned meat to the pan for a final time along with the bulb of garlic, turning the meat occasionally to get an even golden colour.",
      "Meanwhile, peel, quarter and add the onion. Finely slice the fennel stalks, stopping when you hit the bulb, finely slice the leafy tops, and cut the bulb into quarters, adding to the pan as you go.",
      "Scrape up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, then make a well in the middle and add the final 50g of butter.",
      "Use a speed-peeler to peel big chunks of lemon zest into the butter, pick in a large handful of sage leaves and add the cinnamon stick. Fry for a couple of minutes, or until the veg is softened, stirring occasionally.",
      "Pour in around 1 litre of milk (half of the chicken should be submerged) and scrape up all the lovely sticky bits. Squeeze in the lemon juice. The lemon zest will sort of split the milk, making a sauce which is absolutely fantastic. Reduce the heat, cover with a cartouche (greaseproof-paper disc) and simmer for 50 minutes, removing for the final 20 minutes. Taste and check the seasoning and remove the cinnamon stick.",
      "To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide between plates. Spoon over plenty of juice and the little curds. Delicious served with Parmesan polenta and lemony greens."

When it comes to the type of pasta, you can serve carbonara with spaghetti or linguine, but I’ve been told by Italian mammas (who I don’t argue with!) that penne is the original, so that’s what I’m using in this recipe.

Pick, chop and sprinkle in the thyme leaves (reserving any flowers), give everything a stir, so the courgettes become coated with all the lovely bacon-flavoured oil, and fry until they start to turn lightly golden and have softened slightly.",
      "It’s very important to get this next bit right or your carbonara could end up ruined. You need to work quickly. When the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a little of the cooking water. Immediately, toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes, bacon and lovely flavours, then remove from the heat and add a ladleful of the reserved cooking water and your creamy sauce. Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you’ll scramble the eggs.)",

      "There are some beautiful Mediterranean vibes going on in this dish – juicy ripe tomatoes, fresh fragrant basil and delicious olives, all tossed and tangled up in al dente spaghetti. The flavour combo here is mega-simple, but when you put them together, something magical happens. Let the tomatoes ripen naturally out of the fridge – the warmth will ensure all those lovely flavours and juices are at their best and ready to flow. Tomatoes are a source of vitamin C, a nutrient our bodies need for so many different things, including immune function and keeping our energy levels up.",
      "Cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente, which means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of bite and firmness to it.",

      "When it’s ready, fish out the bay leaf and season to how you like it (it’s important to season the sauce right at the end – it will thicken and intensify in flavour as it cooks, so you might find it’s salty enough already).",

It was really only once I started looking after chickens that I started to get the hang of making them.

      "This is going to sound cheffy, but it’s simple, so bear with me ... Tear off 8 sheets of good- quality cling film, each roughly 40cm square. Get yourself 4 teacups or small bowls and rub the rims with olive oil. Place a double layer of cling film on top of each one and carefully push it in so that it snugly lines the cups. Use your finger to lightly oil the inside – this will help your egg come out easily at the end. Put a tiny pinch of salt, pepper and chilli flakes into each cup then pick the celery and tarragon leaves and divide them between the cups too – try to help these flavours to spread up the sides, if you can.",
      "Carefully crack the egg into the cling film, then gently push the yolk down so the egg white surrounds it (without it breaking). Bring the cling film up into a bundle, then tie it in a knot and try to squeeze the knot down so it creates a perfect pouch and seals it (imagine a goldfish in a fairground plastic bag).",
      "Once the water is boiling, remove the bowl (the butter should be melted now) and place your eggs in the water along with the asparagus. It takes between 5 and 6 minutes at a gentle simmer for a large egg. Place the bowl or a lid back on top and after 3 or 4 minutes remove the asparagus to the bowl of lemony butter and quickly toss.",
      "Meanwhile, arrange 2 pieces of smoked salmon on each plate. Pull out one of your eggs after 5 minutes and have a little feel (it should have a similar texture to fresh mozzarella). If it still seems undercooked, pop it back in for another minute or so.",
      "Neatly divide the asparagus between your plates. Cut off the cling film knots with a pair of scissors, peel away the rest, then carefully lift the eggs with a tablespoon and serve them right on top of your asparagus. If you‘ve done a good job, not only will you have perfect poached eggs, but the herbs and seasonings will have cooked into the egg and become one, like a stained glass window, which is really cute. Poke a knife into the egg to let the yolk run, and serve with wedges of lemon on the side."

      "Some people like to fry them in oil, but this makes them greasy and is not all that healthy. You can grill them, but I like to put them in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, so that after about a minute and a half on each side you are left with a really crispy outside and an oozy, stringy filling.
