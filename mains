      "1 small handful of Parmesan cheese",
      "olive oil",
      "6 slices of back bacon",
      "½ a bunch of fresh thyme , (15g)",
      "a few courgette flowers , (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Put a large pan of salted water on to boil.",
      "Halve and then quarter any larger courgettes lengthways. Cut out and discard any fluffy middle bits, and slice the courgettes at an angle into pieces roughly the same size and shape as the penne. Smaller courgettes can simply be sliced finely.",
      "Your water will now be boiling, so add the penne to the pan and cook according to the packet instructions.",
      "To make your creamy carbonara sauce, separate the eggs and put the yolks into a bowl (saving the whites for another recipe). Add the cream and grate in half the Parmesan, and mix together with a fork. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and put to one side.",
      "Heat a very large frying pan (a 35cm one is a good start – every house should have one!) and add a good splash of olive oil. Cut the pancetta or bacon into chunky lardons and fry until dark brown and crisp.",
      "Add the courgette slices and 2 big pinches of black pepper, not just to season but to give it a bit of a kick. Pick, chop and sprinkle in the thyme leaves (reserving any flowers), give everything a stir, so the courgettes become coated with all the lovely bacon-flavoured oil, and fry until they start to turn lightly golden and have softened slightly.",
      "It’s very important to get this next bit right or your carbonara could end up ruined. You need to work quickly. When the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a little of the cooking water. Immediately, toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes, bacon and lovely flavours, then remove from the heat and add a ladleful of the reserved cooking water and your creamy sauce. Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you’ll scramble the eggs.)",
      "Get everyone around the table, ready to eat straight away. While you’re tossing the pasta and sauce, grate in the rest of the Parmesan and add a little more of the cooking water if needed, to give you a silky and shiny sauce. Taste quickly for seasoning.",
      "If you’ve managed to get any courgette flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long."

      "Just under half fill a large sturdy pan with vegetable oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go.",

What works for me every time is taking the fillet out of the bag, quickly patting it with kitchen paper then rolling it in olive oil and putting it on the hottest part of the barbecue to give it colour. Rub it with a chilled knob of butter as you cook it for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning every minute. Once it looks good, move the fillet to a cooler part of the barbecue to finish cooking to your liking. Another 4 to 5 minutes, turning every minute, should give you medium-done meat. If you like it medium rare, cook it for less, or more for well done. It’s better to err on the side of under-done. That way, the worst-case scenario is that you take the fillet off, slice into it and find that it’s under-cooked, then have to put it back.",

Peas and broad beans are sweet and have a pleasant texture, so they should prove popular, even with fussy eaters. If you grow either of these vegetables in your garden, get the kids involved in picking and shelling them, although defrosted peas and beans from the freezer will work just as well here. If you want to make the dish more substantial, you can always add some cooked and sliced new potatoes. Frittata is a simple, healthy addition to your regular dinner repertoire, but also works as a cold dish on picnics. ”",

      "Make your dough first. Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well.",
      "Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined. Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor – just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands.",
      "Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There’s no secret to kneading – you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky.",
      "Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.",
      "It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t got a pasta machine, just use your rolling pin. The problem you’ll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You’ll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you’ll get from a machine.",
      "If using a machine, make sure it’s firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips.",
      "Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks. Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again.",
      "Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times.",
      "Work the dough through all the machine’s settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough.",
      "Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges.",
      "For the lasagne sheets needed in this recipe, keep rolling the pasta until it’s somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card.",
      "Cut the pasta into 6 sheets of 8cm x 30cm, and cut the rest into 8cm x 12cm sheets. It dries faster than you might think, so don’t wait more than a minute or two to cut it. Lay a damp tea towel on top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.",
      "For the béchamel sauce, place the milk and saffron in a saucepan and bring almost to the boil.",
      "In a second pan, melt 75g of the butter. Stir in the flour to make a paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the hot milk to the pan, a ladleful at a time, whisking as you go.",
      "Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Finely grate and stir in most of the Parmesan and season well.",
      "Scrub and debeard the mussels, discarding any that remain open when tapped. Halve the sole fillets lengthways, then thinly slice the salmon.",
      "Melt the remaining butter in a large, deep frying pan. Peel, finely slice and fry the garlic over a medium heat for 1 minute, or until golden.",
      "Add the rosemary sprigs and anchovies to the pan and fry for a few more minutes, or until the anchovies have dissolved.",
      "Add the mussels, shake the pan and cook, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mussels have all opened (throw away any that haven’t after this time).",
      "Turn off the heat, then remove the mussels from their shells, putting the meat back into the pan (discard the shells). Stir to coat in the garlicky juices, discard the rosemary sprigs, then stir the mussel mixture through the béchamel sauce.",
      "Grease 6 individual baking dishes (measuring about 12cm x 16cm each) with a little oil and bring a large pan of salted water to the boil.",
      "Cook the sheets of pasta, a few pieces at a time, for about 1 minute. Remove with tongs and spread over a clean tea towel to drain.",
      "To assemble, place a long sheet of lasagne across each dish so that it overhangs the sides. Add a mixed layer of lemon sole and salmon, then spoon over a layer of the béchamel. Top with a smaller rectangle of pasta.",
      "Repeat until you get to the last of the béchamel sauce, then fold over the overhanging pasta to enclose. Top each lasagne with a king prawn, then scatter over the remaining Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

      "Remove the prawn shells, leaving the tails on. Butterfly the prawns by cutting along the back of each, and opening them up like a book.",
      "Place into a bowl, add the basil paste, and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinate in the fridge for a few hours, or ideally overnight.",
      "Score a cross in the top of each tomato, pop them in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave them for a minute or so, until the skin starts to peel away.",
      "Drain the tomatoes and leave to cool slightly, then peel off the skins (discard them) and roughly chop the flesh. Set aside.",

      "Deseed and finely slice the remaining chilli, then peel and finely slice the rest of the garlic. Add both into the pan, followed by the oregano and basil stalks. Fry for a few minutes, then stir in the tomatoes.",
      "Add a few splashes of water, bring it to a simmer, then reduce the heat a little and keep it simmering for about 30 minutes, until the aubergine has cooked down and the sauce is thick.",
      "Just before the sauce is done, place a griddle pan over a high heat. Once it’s screaming hot, cook your prawns for 1½ minutes on each side, until charred, pink and cooked. Drop the prawns into the sauce as you go.",
      "Stir the remaining basil leaves into the sauce, then serve it topped with a few rocket leaves, if you like."

If you’ve got a 6kg bird, like I had here, do it for 2 hours 42 minutes – this sounds very precise, but I find that 27 minutes per kilo for a higher-welfare bird is the sweet spot.",
      "Remove the tin foil about 45 minutes before the end of cooking, to allow the turkey to get nice and golden.",
      "To check it’s cooked, the simplest way is to stick a knife into the thickest part of the thigh – if the juices run clear, it’s done. If you’re worried, you could also use a meat thermometer. You want to reach an internal temperature of 65ºC for a top-quality bird, such as Paul Kelly’s turkeys, or 70ºC for a supermarket higher-welfare or standard bird.",
      "Use heavy duty tongs to lift up your bird so all the juices run from the cavity into the tray, then transfer the turkey to a platter, cover it with a double layer of tin foil and a clean tea towel, and leave to rest for up to 2 hours while you crack on with everything else.",

      "Remove the wing, slice the skin beside the leg, then pull out and chop the legs off. You can either slice or pull this brown meat – it’s so tasty. Keep it warm while you move on to the breast meat. Use the full length of the knife in a nice smooth action to slice through the breast meat, transferring it to a platter as you go.",
      "Remove the leg as above, then feel where the backbone is and cut with the length of your knife all the way down beside it until you hit the carcass. You can then lift the whole breast off the bone. Remove to a board and slice."

This vegetarian tagine doesn’t need meat for flavour – the vegetables absorb the essences of the coriander, cumin, saffron, ginger and tomato-y stock.

    "instructions": [
      "For the marinade, mix the tamarind paste with 3 tablespoons of boiling water, crush the allspice berries, zest and juice the orange, finely grate half the nutmeg, pick the thyme leaves and roughly chop the bay. Combine these and all the remaining marinade ingredients in a bowl or dish that’s large enough to hold the turkey.",
      "Place the turkey in the dish and rub the marinade all over. Cover with clingfilm. If you don’t have a large enough container, transfer the turkey to a large plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. Refrigerate to marinate overnight.",
      "For the spicy cornbread, preheat the oven to 220ºC/gas 7. Line the base and sides of a 24cm x 24cm baking dish with greaseproof paper and grease the paper. Peel and chop the onion, drain the sweetcorn, deseed and finely chop the Scotch bonnet, then melt the butter. Heat the oil in a pan, add the onion and cook over a medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes until softened. Transfer to a bowl, allow to cool, then add the corn and chilli.",
      "In a separate bowl, combine the flour, polenta, baking powder, sugar and 1 teaspoon sea salt, then stir in the onions. Stir in the milk and melted butter until combined.",
      "Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and cut off any excess paper with scissors. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan. You can cook the bread the day before you eat and store in an airtight container.",
      "For the stuffing, peel and roughly chop the onion and garlic, deseed and finely chop the Scotch bonnet, skin and roughly chop the chorizo and roughly chop the spicy cornbread. Drain and roughly chop the peppers, pick and roughly chop the coriander leaves, pick the thyme leaves and roughly chop the bay. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, scotch bonnet and chorizo and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool then mix in all the stuffing ingredients.",
      "For the rum butter, put all ingredients in a food processor and blitz until combined. Chill until ready to use.",
      "Preheat the oven to its highest temperature. Remove the turkey from the fridge and place on a large board (reserve the marinade for basting). Carefully pack as much of the stuffing into the neck cavity as you can fit. Take some small metal skewers and pierce the skin on either side to close the cavity and keep the stuffing in. Put the remaining stuffing in a lightly greased baking dish and set aside in the fridge.",
      "Halve the carrots lengthways, peel and slice the clementines, and halve the orange. Peel and cut the onions into wedges, and roughly chop the celery. Put the carrot, fruit, onion and celery in a large roasting tin then place the turkey on top. Rub the rum butter all over the turkey, season well, then brush with some marinade and place in the oven. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes at the highest heat then reduce the heat to 180ºC/gas 4, cover the turkey with foil and roast for 35 to 40 minutes per kilo, basting with the marinade every 30 minutes.",
      "Remove the foil during the last hour of cooking so the skin gets crisp, and baste more frequently. You can use a meat thermometer to check if it’s cooked – insert into the thickest part of the breast; the turkey is ready when it registers 72ºC. Add the tray of stuffing to the oven for the last 15 minutes of cooking time, and bake while the turkey rests (45 minutes in total).",
      "Transfer the turkey to a board (reserve the pan juices), and brush off some of the blackened marinade to reveal the bronzed skin. Cover with 2 layers of foil and 2 tea towels and rest for at least 30 minutes.",
      "Chop the kale and boil in salted water for 5 minutes, till tender. Drain, reserving some of the water. Finely slice the chilli and peel and finely slice the garlic. Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the chilli and garlic and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the kale, stir well then transfer to a serving bowl.",
      "Next, make the gravy. Remove the excess fat from the reserved pan juices, then place the pan on a medium heat and stir. Add the flour and stir for a few minutes then add the rum, tomato paste and a little of the kale’s cooking water. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes or until beginning to thicken. Strain into a jug.",
      "Transfer the turkey to a serving platter, and transfer the extra stuffing to the open cavity. Carry to the table, carve and serve slices with stuffing, kale, gravy. Delicious served with mashed potatoes."

    "instructions": [
      "Make your dough first. Place the flour on a board or in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Beat the egg until smooth, then pour it into the well.",
      "Using the tips of your fingers, gradually mix the egg with the flour until combined.",
      "Knead the bits of dough into one smooth lump. You can also do this step in a food processor – just whiz the flour and egg until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip onto a work surface and bring together with your hands.",
      "Knead the dough to develop the gluten; this makes your pasta springy instead of flabby when you cook it. There’s no secret to kneading – you just have to bash the dough around a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, stretching it and squashing it again. Stop when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky. Wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.",
      "It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t got a pasta machine, just use a rolling pin. The problem you’ll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces. You’ll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than you’ll get from a machine.",
      "If using a machine, make sure it’s firmly clamped to a clean, long work surface. Dust the surface with flour, then take a lump of dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips.",
      "Set the pasta machine at its widest setting and roll the dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks.",
      "Click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again. Fold the dough in half, click the machine back up to the widest setting and roll it through again. Repeat 5 or 6 times.",
      "Work the dough through all the machine’s settings, from the widest to the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the dough with flour every time you run it through. When you reach the narrowest setting, fold the dough in half, then in half again, then once more into a squarish piece of dough.",
      "Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll through the settings for the last time, you should get a silky, rectangular sheet of pasta with straight edges.",
      "For the lasagne sheets needed in these recipes, keep rolling the pasta until it’s somewhere between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card.",
      "Cut the pasta into 10cm x 20cm sheets. It dries faster than you might think, so don’t wait more than a minute or two to cut it. Lay a damp tea towel on top of the pasta to help prevent it drying out.",
      "Peel and finely slice the garlic. Peel all the onions, finely chop 3 and cut the remaining onion into wedges. Trim and finely chop the celery and carrots, and pick and finely chop the rosemary.",
      "Heat a good lug of oil in a large, deep saucepan. Fry the garlic over a medium heat for 1 minute, or until golden. Add the finely chopped onions to the pan with the carrot and celery. Fry over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the veg are soft but not coloured.",
      "Add the rosemary, oregano, tomatoes, wine and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and bring to the boil, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon. Reduce the heat and leave to simmer for 1 hour, or until thickened.",
      "Chop up the meat or pulse in a food processor, then stir into the ragù for the final 15 minutes, or until the meat is heated through and the sauce is thick, rich and glossy. Stir the sauce regularly and loosen with a splash of boiling water from the kettle if it’s too thick for your liking.",
      "When the ragù is almost there, preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and start your béchamel sauce. Pour the milk into a large saucepan over a low heat. Add the peppercorns and the remaining onion and gently bring almost to the boil.",
      "Melt the butter in a second saucepan. Stir in the flour to create a paste and cook over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.",
      "Whisk in the hot milk, a ladleful at a time (discard the onion and peppercorns). Gently bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Grate and stir in most of the Parmesan and season to taste.",
      "Grease a large rectangular or round baking dish with a little oil and bring a pan of salted water to the boil.",
      "Add the lasagne sheets to the pan, a few sheets at a time, and cook for 1 minute or so per batch. Remove the pasta with tongs and spread out on a clean tea towel to drain.",
      "Drape a single layer of lasagne over the base of the baking dish. Spread over a thin layer of ragù, top with another layer of pasta and then spread over a thin layer of béchamel sauce.",
      "Repeat as many times as you can (6 to 8, ideally), finishing with a layer of pasta topped with béchamel sauce.",
      "Tear over the mozzarella, then finish with the remaining grated Parmesan and a drizzle of oil. Pick and scatter over the basil leaves.",
      "Bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes, or until golden on top and bubbling at the edges. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

      "Carefully lift the chicken out with tongs and put aside (use in the Leftover chicken with tomatoes & chorizo recipe). Pour the soup through a fine sieve, discarding what’s left behind. To further clarify it, strain through 4 layers of muslin. Have a taste to check the flavour balance, and season with sea salt and black pepper, if needed.",
      "Skim off fat if serving straightaway. If you’re leaving it for another time, chill, then scoop off any fat that sets on the surface. Gently reheat the soup before serving. If you think it needs a bit of a colour boost, scoop out a cup of the broth and add 1 tablespoon of tomato purée to it. Mix until well combined then return to the broth and mix again.",
      "Delicious served simply with a drizzle of basil oil, a few herb tips and a shaving of Parmesan, if you like."

      "CHRISTMAS TURKEY WITH HOMEMADE GRAVY",
      "1 x 5 kg free-range turkey",
      "4 cloves of garlic",
      "1 lemon",
      "a few sprigs of fresh thyme",
      "a few sprigs of fresh rosemary",
      "100 g unsalted butter , (at room temperature), plus extra for greasing",
      "2 onions",
      "2 sticks of celery",
      "2 carrots",
      "3 clementines",
      "1 litre organic chicken stock , fresh if you can get it",
      "2 tablespoons plain flour",
      "1 splash red wine",
      "PORK & ONION STUFFING",
      "4 onions",
      "1 large handful of dried fruit , such as apricots, cranberries, prunes, dates",
      "1 large handful of mixed unsalted nuts , such as almonds, shelled pistachios, pine nuts",
      "1/2 bunch of fresh thyme",
      "75 g stale bread",
      "olive oil",
      "1 teaspoon allspice",
      "300 g higher-welfare pork mince",
      "ROAST POTATOES & VEG",
      "1 kg parnsips",
      "1.5 kg red-skinned potatoes",
      "500 g small carrots",
      "300 g shallots",
      "1 bulb of garlic",
      "a few sprigs of fresh rosemary"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Remove the turkey from of the fridge 1 hour in advance to come up to room\ntemperature.",
      "For the stuffing, peel and finely chop the onions, roughly chop the dried fruit and nuts, and pick the thyme leaves. Whiz the bread into breadcrumbs in a food processor.",
      "Heat a lug of oil in a large pan on a medium heat, then add the onion. Cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly. Add the allspice, dried fruit, nuts, thyme and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, then transfer to a large bowl and leave to cool completely.",
      "Once cool, add the pork mince and breadcrumbs to the bowl and scrunch everything together with clean hands. Reserve about half the stuffing for the turkey, then transfer the rest to a greased baking dish (approximately 20cm). Spread it out in an even layer, keeping it rough on top, then put aside.",
      "Preheat the oven to full whack. Rinse the turkey under the cold tap, then\npat it dry, inside and out, with kitchen paper.",
      "Peel and crush the garlic, finely grate the lemon zest, then pick and roughly chop the thyme and rosemary. In a small bowl, mix the soft butter, garlic, lemon zest, half the thyme and rosemary leaves and a good pinch of salt and pepper.",
      "Push your finger and thumb between the skin and the flesh around the main cavity to make a gap and use a spatula to push in the butter. Squash the skin back down and use your hands to smooth and spread the butter under the skin. Open up the neck cavity and pack in the reserved stuffing. Pull the skin over the cavity and tuck it under the bird.",
      "Drizzle the bird with oil and season with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then rub this into the meat. Cut the zested lemon in half and place in the empty cavity.",
      "Peel and roughly chop the onion, trim and roughly chop the celery and carrot, then place in a large roasting tray with the turkey on top. Cover with tin foil then place in the hot oven. Immediately reduce the temperature to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cook for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilo – the 5kg bird in this recipe will take about 3 to 3½ hours.",
      "Check your turkey every 30 minutes or so – spoon over any juices from the\nbottom of the tray to keep it juicy. After 2½ hours, remove the foil so the skin crisps up. Thirty minutes before the turkey is ready, mix the remaining herbs with oil and scatter over the bird. Halve and add the clementines to the tray and leave in for the remaining cooking time.",
      "To check the turkey is cooked, stick a small sharp knife into the fattest part\nof the thigh. If the juices run clear and the meat pulls apart easily, it’s ready. If not, cook it for a bit longer then check again. Once done, transfer the turkey to a serving platter and turn the oven up to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Cover the turkey with tin foil and 2 clean tea towels to keep it warm. Leave to rest for about 30 minutes while you cook your veg, stuffing and gravy.",
      "For the roast potatoes and veg, peel the parsnips, scrub the potatoes and carrots, then peel and halve the shallots. Break the garlic bulb up into cloves. Parboil the baby carrots in a pan of boiling salted water on a high heat for 5 minutes. Drain them in a colander and leave to steam dry. Chop the potatoes into 2cm chunks and peel and halve the parsnips lengthways.",
      "Add the veg to 2 large roasting trays with the shallots. Crush the garlic cloves with the heel of your hand and pick the rosemary leaves. Add both\nto the trays along with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Drizzle everything generously with oil and toss well to coat. Roast in the hot oven along with the stuffing for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through.",
      "When the veg and stuffing are in the oven, warm the stock in a pan on a\nmedium heat. Skim most of the fat away from the roasting tray, then stir in the flour, using a wooden spoon to scrape up all the sticky bits from the bottom.",
      "Place on a medium heat and add the red wine. Once that has cooked away, pour in the stock, bring it all to the boil, then reduce to a medium heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until you get a good consistency.",
      "Carefully pour the gravy through a sieve into a serving jug, using a spoon to push all that goodness through. Discard anything left in the sieve. Carve your turkey in the kitchen or at the table, and serve with all the usual trimmings."

      "When it’s ready, fish out the bay leaf and season to how you like it (it’s important to season the sauce right at the end – it will thicken and intensify in flavour as it cooks, so you might find it’s salty enough already).",
      "Divide the sauce between freezer-proof containers and leave to cool, then label and pop into the freezer for up to 3 months, to use whenever you like. This is great as a simple pasta sauce or in my lasagne, with simple spaghetti & meatballs or as a tasty base for pizza."

Fold in three-quarters of the potato matchsticks and take the pan off the heat – the eggs will continue to cook in the pan, so make sure you don’t overcook them at this stage.",

    "instructions": [
      "For the tomato sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then fry in a good amount of olive oil until lightly coloured. Pick and tear the basil leaves, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Using the back of a wooden spoon, mush and squash the tomatoes as much as you can. Season to taste.",
      "As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the pan from the heat. Strain the sauce through a coarse sieve into a bowl, using the spoon to push any larger bits of tomato through. Discard the basil and garlic left in the sieve, but scrape any tomatoey goodness off the back of the sieve into the bowl. Pour the sauce back into the pan, bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Cook until it’s the perfect consistency for spreading on your pizza bases.",
      "For the pizza dough, sieve the flour and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into 650ml lukewarm water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. When it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for an hour until the dough has doubled in size.",
      "Remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out. You can use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straight away, divide the dough up into 6 to 8 balls.",
      "Timing-wise, it’s a good idea to roll the pizza bases out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Stack the pizza bases, with a square of oiled tin foil between each one, cover them with clingfilm, and pop them into the fridge. Now’s the time to get your wood-fired oven, or conventional oven, heated up to full whack. Place a couple of heavy baking trays in the oven to heat up, too.",
      "Meanwhile, click off the broccoli florets and roughly chop (using the stalk, too). Blanch in boiled salted water for 1 to 2 minutes, then drain. Tear the anchovies into small pieces, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Squeeze the sausage meat out of their skins, then roll into small, rough meatballs.",
      "When you’re ready to assemble your pizzas, remove a tray from the oven, put a pizza base on it and assemble it quickly – smear tomato sauce on the base and dot with broccoli, torn up anchovy fillets and sausage meatballs. Tear over the Taleggio cheese and sprinkle with chilli. Crush and scatter over the fennel seeds. Place in the oven immediately while you prepare the remaining pizzas. If you’re using a wood-fired oven the pizzas should cook, one by one, in about 3 to 4 minutes – you want them to be puffed up, crispy and delicious. In a regular oven, they’ll take 8 to 10 minutes. Serve hot."

Cook for around 3 hours, or until cooked through, golden and crisp. To check, insert a skewer into the thickest part of the thigh – if the juices run clear, it’s done.",
      "When the goose has been roasting for 2 hours, remove the veg tray from the oven and replace it with another tray. Skim away the fat from the veg tray (reserve it in a jar with a few extra bay leaves to make amazing roasties or my sweet glazed carrots), then place the tray on the hob over a high heat.",
      "Add the port and cook for around 3 minutes, or until reduced. Stir in the flour for a minute, then pour in the stock. Reduce to a simmer for around 10 minutes, or until thickened to a nice gravy consistency. Sieve into a medium pan, then set aside.",
      "When the time’s up on the goose, remove it from the oven, cover with a double layer of tin foil and a tea towel and leave to rest for 20 to 25 minutes.",
      "Remove the tray from the oven, skim away and reserve the fat, then pour any juices into the gravy. Warm up the gravy on a medium heat.",
      "Once rested, place the goose on a board and remove the skin – pop this into the oven for another 10 minutes to crisp it up nicely (keep an eye on it!).",
      "Carve away the legs, then shred the meat with two forks, discarding the bones. Carefully slice away the breasts, then slice up and place on a platter with the remaining shredded meat.",
      "Halve the pomegranate, then holding it in the palm of your hand cut-side down over the platter, bash the back with a wooden spoon so the seeds come tumbling out. Snap the crispy skin over the top, then serve with your hot gravy and all the trimmings."

Tossed with the most incredible peanut dressing, which to be honest is more of a substantial sauce, and served with something crunchy on the side, such as prawn crackers, it’s a winning combination. ”",

      "Finely shred the cabbage if you want it raw or, if you’d rather cook it (which is traditional), cut it into 2cm slices, place in a colander and slowly pour a kettle of boiling water over the top.

      "Traditionally, you’d take a little bit of everything, put it into a bowl and pour the sauce over the top, which is a fine way to serve it. I like to do the reverse, because I feel that once you pour the sauce over you can’t see the care and attention that has gone into the preparation of the ingredients. So I spoon the sauce between four bowls, spread it up around the sides, then divide the ingredients around the bowls, taking a bit of pride in making them look nice.",

    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3.",
      "In a snug-fitting high-sided roasting tray, rub the lamb all over with a little oil and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Add a splash of water to the tray, then roast for 4 hours, or until the meat is tender and will fall away from the bone.",
      "Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tray, then lift the lamb out onto a board, take all the meat and crispy skin off the bone and roughly chop it, reserving the bones.",
      "Skim away any fat from the tray and pop it into a clean jam jar. Add a splash of boiling water to the tray and stir around to pick up all the lovely sticky bits from the bottom. Keep it all to one side.",
      "For the filling, peel and roughly dice the onions, carrots, celery and swede, then put them into your biggest pan on a medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of reserved lamb fat. Strip in the rosemary leaves, then fry the veg for 20 minutes, or until lightly caramelised, stirring regularly.",
      "Stir in the flour, lamb, bones and tray juices, then pour in 1.5 litres of water. Bring to the boil, then put the lid on and reduce to a gentle simmer for 40 minutes, or until you’ve got a loose, stew-like consistency, stirring occasionally.",
      "To guarantee intense gravy and a tender but dense filling, remove and discard the bones, then place a large coarse sieve over a pan and, in batches, spoon the lamb stew into the sieve. Let the gravy drip through, and after a couple of minutes, when you get a dense pile of meat and veg in the sieve, transfer that to a bowl, leaving the gravy in the pan.",
      "Separately freeze half the cool meat and gravy for another day.",
      "For the topping, sides and bottom, peel and roughly chop the potatoes and cook in boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and leave to steam dry, then add the butter, grate in half the cheese, season to perfection with salt and pepper, mash well and cool completely.",
      "Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.",
      "Use a little reserved lamb fat to grease the inside of a large pie dish (25cm x 30cm), then pick and tear over the rosemary leaves and sprinkle with half the breadcrumbs – they’ll stick to the fat and add an incredible crunch.",
      "A handful at a time, press the cooled mash into the dish, covering the bottom and sides with a 1cm-thick layer. Spoon in the filling and a couple of spoonfuls of gravy, smooth out, then top with the remaining mash, pat it flat, scuff it up with a fork and pinch it at the edges.",
      "Grate over the rest of the cheese, scatter with the remaining breadcrumbs and drizzle lightly with oil. Importantly, bake on the bottom of the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden.",
      "Warm your gravy through (reducing if desired), then serve the pie with loads of seasonal greens or peas and lots of condiments."

You can bake them completely in the oven and skip the frying altogether, you just need to drizzle them with olive oil and bake for about 20 minutes – they won’t be as golden, but they’ll be just as delicious.",
      "Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the potatoes and cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender.",
      "Chop up the broccoli and add it to the potatoes for the last 8 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper.",
      "Divide the mash between your plates and place a Kiev on top of each portion. Lightly dress the spinach leaves or rocket in a little oil and lemon juice, then sprinkle over the top as a salady garnish. Serve with a wedge of lemon on the side."

      "Turn the heat up to high, add the wine and cook it away, then reduce the heat back to medium and stir in the flour, followed by the milk and mustard. Mix well and simmer for 10 minutes while you prepare the lobster.",
      "Twist the lobster head and body apart – importantly, shake out all the tasty juice and bits from the head into the sauce. Squeeze the tail shell in until you hear it crack, then rip it open the other way to expose all that lovely tail meat. Rip the claws off the body, then use a rolling pin on a board to crack them open and poke out any meat you can find.",
      "Roughly chop all the meat, reserving the tail, shell and head. Scroll down to the bottom of the page for our helpful video on how to prepare your lobster.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little cooking water.",
      "Remove the sauce from the heat, stir in the pasta and lobster meat and grate in the Cheddar and Gruyère. Mix well, taste and correct the seasoning – you don’t want the sauce to be super-thick now, so loosen it with a little cooking water if needed, remembering that it will thicken as it bakes.",
      "Finely grate over the Parmesan (I didn’t do it in the picture, but you can add a sprinkling of breadcrumbs before the cheese too, if you like). For a bit of fun, pop the lobster head and tail into the pan at either end. Cook in the oven for about 35 minutes, or until golden, bubbling and delicious.",

Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, then remove from the heat and blitz until smooth with a stick blender. Taste and season to perfection, then place back on a very low heat.",

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven and a large baking tray to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.",
      "Start by making the pastry. Sift the flour and xanthan gum into a food processor, add the margarine, vegetable shortening and a pinch of sea salt, and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and cut together with the flat of a knife.",
      "Add 2 tablespoons of cold water, pulsing as you go (or stirring with a flat-bladed knife, if making the pastry by hand), until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough.",
      "Tip the pastry into a large bowl (or keep in the same bowl, if making it by hand) and, using your fingertips, pull together into a ball. Knead lightly for about 2 minutes or until smooth and elastic.",
      "Shape the pastry into a ball and place between 2 large sheets of clingfilm, then roll it out into a circle slightly larger than the tart tin and no thinner than 3mm. Peel off the uppermost sheet of clingfilm and carefully flip the pastry into a deep 23cm tart tin. Peel away the remaining clingfilm and gently press the pastry into the sides of the tin, filling in any cracks with pastry and patting it flat with your fingertips. Trim the edges and set aside.",
      "Next, prepare the potatoes. Peel and cut in half, quartering any large ones. Place in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. The second the water begins to boil, time the potatoes, allowing them to cook for 4 minutes before removing from the heat and draining. Shake the potatoes in the colander a little to chuff up the edges – this helps them crisp up.",
      "Pour 8 tablespoons of the groundnut oil into a large roasting tin, tip in the potatoes and 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt and firmly shake to coat evenly. Set aside while you make the filling for the tart.",
      "Finely chop the onion, crush the garlic, then finely grate the carrots. Trim the stalks from the chestnut mushrooms and slice into rounds. Halve 240g of the chestnuts (the rest will be used for the topping).",
      "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the onions and cook gently over a low heat until softened. Add the carrots, garlic, thyme and mushrooms, and fry gently until softened and all of the liquid from the mushrooms has been absorbed – around 10 minutes.",
      "Stir in the cream cheese and halved chestnuts and mix together gently until the cheese has softened and formed a creamy mixture. Season to taste, spoon the filling into the pastry case then level the top.",
      "Place the tart on the baking tray on the top shelf of the oven and the potatoes on the bottom shelf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is crisp.",
      "Remove the tart from the oven, cover loosely in foil to retain its heat and set aside. Move the potatoes to the top shelf of the oven and increase the temperature to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Continue roasting the potatoes for a further 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crisp.",
      "For the gravy, heat the walnut oil and redcurrant jelly in a small saucepan, stirring until melted and smooth. Add the hot stock, bring to a simmer and stir in the cornflour. Simmer gently and stir continuously until you have the desired consistency. Set aside.",
      "Finally, tear the wild mushrooms into pieces, roughly chop the remaining chestnuts and finely chop the parsley. Heat the garlic oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the mushrooms and fry gently until softened. Stir in the chestnuts, cranberries and parsley, and spoon over the tart to form a decorative layer. Reheat the gravy and serve with the tart and roast potatoes."

Place upside-down (so the scruffy edges are underneath) in double-layered, lightly greased muffin cases and divide between two bamboo steamer baskets.",

      "Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Once the buns are ready, sprinkle over the seeds and the reserved spring onions and chilli. Tear the coriander leaves on top, then serve with hoisin sauce for dipping."

Heat a splash of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then add the chopped veg and thyme leaves and fry for around 8 minutes, or until softened.

Drain in a colander, then return the empty pan to a low heat, place the colander on top and allow the potatoes to steam dry for a couple of minutes. Tip out any excess liquid from the pan, then tip in the potatoes, add the butter and about 75ml of milk. Mash well until light, fluffy and smooth, adding a splash more milk if needed. Stir in a few gratings of nutmeg, grate in one-third of the cheese and season to how you like it.",
      "Layer the cheesy mash on top of the beans, carefully spreading it out to the edges in an even layer, then grate over the remaining cheese (I prefer mature Cheddar, but mild is fine too). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the beans are hot through, the cheese is melted and golden, and it's bubbling at the edges. Serve with a crisp green salad and homemade coleslaw. This is my fail-safe go-to dish if I’m in need of a bit of naughty comfort food."

Give it a good stir, let all the ingredients party, then set aside.",

Carefully remove the shells to a serving platter and drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the melted chilli garlic butter over each golden scallop. Roughly chop and scatter over the parsley leaves then serve right away.",

    "description": "“I’ve made a few paellas in my time. The biggest one was for about 800 people in a village in Spain and it was hard work, but an incredible experience. The Spanish can be quite protective about what is and what isn’t a paella, but at the same time, the spirit of their cooking has always been flexible to whatever meat, fish, seafood or game can be found. I’ve eaten and enjoyed many paellas, and I hope you like my humble, great-value expression of one. ”",

      "Place the pork loin on a board, skin side down, and rub all over with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.",
      "To make the stuffing, peel and finely slice the onions, then pick and chop the sage leaves. Place a large pan on a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and the butter, then add the onions, sage, pine nuts, fennel seeds and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden, stirring occasionally.",
      "Meanwhile, place the raisins and Vin Santo in a bowl and set aside to soak. Slice the sourdough and toast until golden, then halve the garlic clove and rub the cut side all over the toast. Pick the rosemary leaves and finely chop with the toast.",
      "Roughly chop the livers and stir into the pan. Turn the heat up to medium-high, stir in the soaked raisins, Vin Santo and toast, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool.",
      "Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7.",
      "Once cool, use clean hands to scrunch the mixture together, then scatter over the pork. Hold the oysters curved side down on a chopping board, look for the hinge between the top and bottom shell, then poke an oyster knife into the crack and prise it open (it’s not always easy, so you’ll need to use force here – but please be careful!). Press the oysters into the filling, and drizzle over any juices.",
      "Finely grate over the Parmesan, then, starting with one of the shortest edges, roll up the pork, patting on and compacting the stuffing as you go. Tie six pieces of string along the rolled meat to secure it, with the seam underneath, then season well and drizzle with oil, rubbing it all over the skin – this will help you get delicious crackling.",
      "Put the pork into a large roasting tray and place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and crackled.",
      "Meanwhile, halve the apples and carrots, then peel and quarter the onions. Remove the pork from the oven and carefully place the apples and veg underneath the pork in the tray, then return to the oven and reduce the temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Cook for a further 4 to 5 hours, or until the meat is really tender, basting now and again.",
      "Remove the porchetta to a clean tray and leave to rest while you make the gravy. Place the roasting tray on a medium heat on the hob. Skim away most of the fat from the surface into a jar, cool, and place in the fridge for another day.",

Use a fork to mix in the flour from the sides, then bring it together with your hands to form a slightly sticky dough.

Grate and sprinkle over equal amounts of the mozzarella, making sure to leave a rough 2cm gap around the edges, then drizzle about 5 tablespoons of tomato sauce onto each – by adding the cheese first and the tomato second, you’ll stop the base from getting soggy.",

      "The gap between Christmas and New Year is one of my favourite times – it’s perfect for relaxing, going for long walks, eating big hearty dinners, chilling out indoors and most importantly, spending time with family. To reflect that vibe, I’ve made this warming, Bloody Mary-spiked beef, which you can leave to tick away for hours while you get on with your day. Served with creamy horseradish mash, this is exactly the fare you’ll want when you return home from a cold stroll outdoors.",
      "Preheat the oven to 130ºC/250ºF/gas ½. Place a snug-fitting casserole pan over a medium heat to get hot. Season the brisket all over with salt and pepper, then add to the hot pan with a splash of olive oil and cook for about 10 minutes, or until gnarly and browned all over. Meanwhile, trim and chop the celery into 5cm chunks, reserving the yellow leaves for later, then peel and quarter the onions. Add the chopped veg to the pan, reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 5 to 10 minutes, or until slightly softened.",
      "Combine all of the Bloody Mary ingredients in a large jug, then pour into the pan with 250ml cold water and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Make a bouquet garni by tying the thyme, rosemary and bay together with string, then add to the pan and bring everything to the boil. Take the pan off the heat and cover with a cartouche – this is basically a scrunched-up piece of greaseproof paper that you place directly on the surface of the food. Cover the pan with tin foil and cook in the oven for 5 to 6 hours, or until the beef is tender and falling apart.",
      "When there’s about 30 minutes to go, peel and slice the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks. Add to a large pan of cold salted water, place over a high heat and bring to the boil, then cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, if using, remove and wash the outer green leaves of the cabbage, then roll them up like a cigar and finely slice. Add the sliced cabbage or curly kale to a pan of boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender, then drain.",
      "Drain the potatoes in a colander and leave to steam dry, then return to the pan and mash well with the butter and horseradish. Season to taste, and add a little more horseradish if it needs it. Divide between plates and spoon over the greens, then pull the beef apart with two forks, pile on top and finely grate over a little fresh horseradish. Scatter over any reserved celery leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve."

      "You won’t believe how tasty the courgettes get with this method of cooking – it really does take them to another level. You’ve got to find some Lincolnshire Poacher, it’s an amazing cheese made by the very talented Jones brothers, Simon and Tim (see www.lincolnshirepoachercheese.com). The pastry is rich and amazing, so embrace the fact that it’s really crumbly and will definitely break as you’re making it. I’m serving this with a lemony salad and sweet salt-baked shallots, which will get caramelized and gorgeous and pick up the seasoning from the bed of salt. This method is also a great one for beetroots, so if you like this, try that.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Blitz the flour and butter in a food processor with a pinch of salt and a few good pinches of pepper until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip on to a work surface, make a well in the centre and add 100ml of cold water. Gently mix until it starts to come together, then – most importantly for a short, crumbly pastry – have the confidence to only just press, pat and almost hug it together to form a rough scruffy ball. Please don’t be tempted to knead the dough or it won’t be short and crumbly. Pop it into a floured bowl, cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to chill while you make the filling.",
      "Put a drizzle of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and pick in the leaves from half the bunch of thyme. Add a few gratings of nutmeg, the zest of half the lemon, the sliced courgettes and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Cook gently (the courgettes will cook down and become easier to handle), stirring occasionally, for around 25 minutes. Then turn the heat down to low and cook for another 20 minutes, so the courgette mixture becomes dense and the flavours really intensify and sweeten. Allow to cool a little, finely chop and crumble in the cheese, then chop and add the mint leaves. Set aside.",
      "Halve the pastry and roll each half into a circle just under 1cm thick and slightly larger than the pie dish you’ve chosen (roughly 23cm diameter x 4cm deep). Don’t worry if the pastry breaks up – that’s normal. Just patch it. Roll one of the circles around the rolling pin and carefully unroll it over the pie dish. Gently press the pastry into the corners and sides of the dish, then spoon and spread all your courgette mixture into the dish. Carefully unroll the pastry lid over the top, then flour your thumb and forefinger and gently pinch and crimp the edges together. Trim off any excess pastry and brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg.",
      "Now simply throw the rock salt into a roasting tray with the shallots, still with their skins on, and a few thyme tips. Put the pie right at the bottom of the oven, with the tray of shallots above. Cook for 1 hour, or until the pie is golden, then allow to cool and serve with those soft roasted shallots.",
      "PS: All the leftover salt from baking the shallots can be bashed up and reused."

      "Rhys Pendergast made a really kind donation to Help a Capital Child this year, so I’m dedicating this dish to him, in celebration of his wedding to the lovely Katie. I’m told Rhys makes a mean toad-in-the-hole, and I hope they enjoy this version for years to come. In Yorkshire, I learned how real Yorkshire folk approach making a great Yorkie. They aren’t into making their batter the night before, instead they focus on getting plenty of air into the batter and achieving a hot consistent temperature in the oven. I truly love this great classic and have only ever had one issue with it: quite often, you end up with half a sausage (the toad) poking out of the Yorkshire (the hole). The bit sticking out is crispy and golden – good times – but the other half of the sausage, inside the batter, is soft, anaemic and boiled – bad times. So in the spirit of family-style sharing and creating a dish that makes everyone go ‘Oooh!’ I’m separating out the elements so you end up with amazing crispy sausages, a tray of giant Yorkshire to tear up and a wonderful onion and apple gravy. Heaven.",
      "Whisk the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then pour into a jug. Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Cut your onions into 1cm thick slices, and do the same with the apples – removing the core. Put a large pan on a medium heat. Add the butter, a lug of olive oil, the onions and the apples. Pick in the leaves from 2 sprigs of rosemary. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Remove the sauce from the heat once soft, season, and add the honey and a splash of water, if needed. Put the sausages into a sturdy roasting tray (roughly 30 x 40cm), toss with a little olive oil and cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden.",
      "Transfer the cooked sausages to a pretty ovenproof dish and toss with half the apple and onion sauce. Cover with tin foil. Remove any excess fat from the roasting tray, replace with a good lug of olive oil and place on a medium heat. Add the remaining rosemary leaves and after 30 seconds, pour in the batter, then put straight into the middle of the oven with the sausages on the shelf underneath. Cook for around 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pudding is fluffy, golden and puffing up at the sides. Whatever you do, do not open the oven door.",
      "Put the pan of apples and onions back on a high heat and stir in the flour. Be brave; let it get really golden before adding the cider, stock and a couple of really good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Let it boil and bubble away until thickened to your liking. Get your guests to the table, with their knives and forks in their hands. Put the bubbling gravy on a board in the middle of the table.",
      "Remove and uncover your sizzling sausages, then slide your Yorkshire pudding on to a nice board. This lovely dish definitely needs balancing, so serve with something green and fresh, like runner beans, greens, salad or dressed chard."

Dip the escalopes, one at a time, into the flour until well coated. Shake off any excess, then dip into the egg. Let the extra egg drip off, then lay the escalope in the breadcrumb mixture.

If your pan isn't big enough, you may have to cook them in batches, adding a little extra oil if needed. Cook for a few minutes on each side until lightly golden, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Get yourself a snug-fitting, appropriately sized baking dish (approx. 30 x 20cm) and spread the tomato sauce in the dish. Lay your escalopes on top, side by side. Tear the buffalo mozzarella into pieces and dot these over the dish with a few basil leaves.",

Place the balls in a large oiled casserole dish or roasting tray, drizzle over a good lug of olive oil, then bang into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes until golden and sizzling.",
      "Meanwhile, crack on with your chilli sauce. Use kitchen paper to wipe out the pan you cooked your onions in, and put it back on a medium heat with a few lugs of olive oil. Add the onion, peppers, garlic, fresh chillies and paprika and fry gently for about 15 minutes. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, vinegar, molasses or sugar, mustard, coffee and tomatoes, and bring everything to the boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. It should be thick and delicious, but if you’d like it a bit thicker just turn the heat up and cook for a few more minutes.",
      "Remove the cooked meatballs from the oven when they’re ready and spoon away as much of the fat from the pan as you can. Pour your chilli sauce over the top, and return the pan to the oven for 5 more minutes. Finely chop your parsley, sprinkle over, and serve with a spoonful of rice or mash and a lemony green salad. The cowboys I met could easily nail two of these in one sitting, but if you aren’t going to be roping cattle all day I’d say one is probably plenty!"

      "Until recently, I’d always seen this type of pizza as a slightly greedy way of bulking out crusts and toppings. I hadn’t realized Italian immigrants had cleverly adapted their old-world recipes to suit new-world coalfired ovens. Making pizzas in tins to protect the base from the soot of the oven makes perfect sense to me now, and I can honestly say that when it’s cooked and seasoned with proper love and care, I’m more than happy with this representative of the pizza family.",
      "To make your dough, pour 650ml of lukewarm water into a large bowl and use a fork to stir in the yeast, sugar and 1 level teaspoon of fine sea salt. Add your flour, bit by bit, until it comes together. You want smooth springy dough, so keep adding a bit more flour if necessary. Dust a clean surface with flour, then knead the dough with your hands. When you’re happy with the consistency, pop it into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm room until the dough has almost doubled in size.",
      "Meanwhile, put a lug of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. Add your sliced onions and thyme leaves and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and golden. Take the pan off the heat and put aside. Put all the tomato sauce ingredients into a food processor or liquidizer with a good pinch of salt and black pepper and blitz to a purée. Have a taste and season carefully, adding a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it.",
      "Slit the sausages open and squeeze the meat into a bowl. Bash up the dried chilli and fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, add these to the meat with the dried oregano and mix well with a fork.",
      "Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Divide the dough in half and oil 2 trays (about 25 x 35cm) with olive oil. Use a rolling pin or clean hands to flatten and stretch the dough out. Roll or push the dough around each tray and really push it into the corners so you get a chubby crust and a base about 1cm thick.",
      "Divide your blitzed tomato sauce between the pizzas and spread around. Scatter over the caramelized onions and dot small pinches of the sausage mixture around the top of each pizza. Tear up the mozzarella and dot the pieces over the sausage, then sprinkle over the fresh basil leaves, sliced fresh chilli, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the grated Parmesan. Finally let your slices of pancetta sort of fall on to the pizzas so they curl and crisp up as they cook. Place in the bottom of the oven for about 20 minutes so the base gets nice and crispy while the top is cooking. Once your pizzas are beautifully cooked, serve right away with a fresh green lemony salad."

The way I heard it, this brilliant rub was invented by an African-American chef working at Commander’s Palace, a posh New Orleans restaurant. The famous head chef there, Paul Prudhomme, took this recipe, added his own little tweaks and introduced blackened fish to the rest of the world. Basically it’s a bold rub that fragrantly flavours fish and meat and goes dark when it cooks, thanks to the paprika and garlic.",
      "Traditionally this dish has been made with the locally caught redfish, but it’s also great with any whole or filleted white fish. It goes with so many things, including chicken, pork, lamb and steak. When I was in Louisiana I cooked it on a barbecue, but I’ve shown you below how to do it indoors in a pan. Don’t be scared by how black the spices go: they’ll look burnt but the taste will be amazing.",
      "To make the rub, bash up your fresh herbs and garlic in a pestle and mortar until you've got a nice coarse paste. Mix in the spices, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, 1 level tablespoon of black pepper and the olive oil, then squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, making sure not to let any pips get in there, and stir well.",
      "Lightly score the skin of your fish in lines about 2cm apart. Using your fingers, smear the rub all over both sides of the fish and into the cuts you've made. Put a non-stick pan or griddle pan over a medium-high heat and let it get nice and hot. Place your fish in the pan, skin side down, and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It will get quite smoky, so you might want to open a window! Turn the heat down to low, then, very carefully, flip your fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side.",
      "Cut your remaining lemon half and your second lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Serve them with your fish, a nice salad and boiled or steamed new potatoes dressed in good olive oil or butter. Don’t forget a nice cold glass of wine!"

    "description": "“Believe it or not, for many years poached eggs were just getting me every time. They were busting, or just generally not great ... It was really only once I started looking after chickens that I started to get the hang of making them. I think even as a chef I’d been taught to create a vortex in the water then pop the egg into the middle, but if you’re cooking for lots of people, that’s a pain. So this new way guarantees a perfectly poached pouch of egg every time. The exciting thing is that by simply tying the egg up in cling film with a few herbs you can flavour the eggs and have confidence they’re going to cook all right. ”",

      "500 g asparagus , woody ends snapped off",
      "8 slices of smoked salmon (roughly 240g)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Half-fill a medium-large saucepan with water, season generously with salt and bring to the boil. Instead of putting a lid on, put a large bowl on top but don’t let it touch the water. Put the butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of 1 lemon into the bowl.",
      "This is going to sound cheffy, but it’s simple, so bear with me ... Tear off 8 sheets of good- quality cling film, each roughly 40cm square. Get yourself 4 teacups or small bowls and rub the rims with olive oil. Place a double layer of cling film on top of each one and carefully push it in so that it snugly lines the cups. Use your finger to lightly oil the inside – this will help your egg come out easily at the end. Put a tiny pinch of salt, pepper and chilli flakes into each cup then pick the celery and tarragon leaves and divide them between the cups too – try to help these flavours to spread up the sides, if you can.",
      "Carefully crack the egg into the cling film, then gently push the yolk down so the egg white surrounds it (without it breaking). Bring the cling film up into a bundle, then tie it in a knot and try to squeeze the knot down so it creates a perfect pouch and seals it (imagine a goldfish in a fairground plastic bag).",
      "Once the water is boiling, remove the bowl (the butter should be melted now) and place your eggs in the water along with the asparagus. It takes between 5 and 6 minutes at a gentle simmer for a large egg. Place the bowl or a lid back on top and after 3 or 4 minutes remove the asparagus to the bowl of lemony butter and quickly toss.",
      "Meanwhile, arrange 2 pieces of smoked salmon on each plate. Pull out one of your eggs after 5 minutes and have a little feel (it should have a similar texture to fresh mozzarella). If it still seems undercooked, pop it back in for another minute or so.",
      "Neatly divide the asparagus between your plates. Cut off the cling film knots with a pair of scissors, peel away the rest, then carefully lift the eggs with a tablespoon and serve them right on top of your asparagus. If you‘ve done a good job, not only will you have perfect poached eggs, but the herbs and seasonings will have cooked into the egg and become one, like a stained glass window, which is really cute. Poke a knife into the egg to let the yolk run, and serve with wedges of lemon on the side."

I was really surprised to find out that Nonno lives by himself, and I was very impressed to hear that he still cooks for himself every day; although there are always friends and family nearby to help him if he needs it. His favourite thing to cook for himself is mussels with pasta, so I’m going to talk you through the recipe as he explained it to me.",
      "Get a pan of salted water on to boil. Pour a few drizzles of extra virgin olive oil into a separate little pan and put it on a medium heat. Add the garlic, dried chilli and anchovy, then squeeze in and add the cherry tomatoes as the garlic begins to fry – at no point should the garlic take on any colour, but you need the heat to be hot enough to melt the anchovies. The juice from the tomatoes and oil will make a light, very delicate and simple sauce.",
      "Add the linguine to the pan of boiling water and cook according to packet instructions. Meanwhile, add a good handful of washed and debearded mussels to the tomato sauce. Give the pan a little toss, then place a lid on top and cook until all the mussels are open. As usual with mussels, if any remain closed after cooking, throw them away. Add a handful of chopped parsley to the pan.",
      "The pasta will now be a little under al dente and only a minute away from being ready. Nonno likes to drain his pasta, saving a little of the cooking water, then he puts the pasta back into the big pot and pours the mussel sauce over the top, mixing everything together well. Put the pot back on a low heat for an extra minute or two to cook the pasta perfectly – it will suck up all the lovely mussel juice. To finish, drizzle over a good bit of olive oil, season to taste and serve immediately."

Lay your chicken breasts on a board and cut three incisions into each one like fingers, going all the way through the breast but leaving about 1cm joined at the top. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Snap the woody ends off of the asparagus spears. Add a splash of olive oil to the pan, followed by the chicken, pancetta and asparagus. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the chicken and asparagus are cooked through, turning halfway. Lift the pancetta on top of the chicken once golden and crispy.",

      "1–2 dried red chillies , crumbled",

      "Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.",
      "Wash the duck and pat it dry, inside and out, with kitchen paper, then rub it all over, inside as well, with sea salt and black pepper. Place it in a tray and roast in the preheated oven for around 2 hours, turning it every now and then. Halfway through, you’ll probably need to drain away a lot of the fat from the bird. Don't throw it away, though! Sieve it and keep the fat (but no meat juices) in a jar in the fridge for a couple of months and use it to roast potatoes.",
      "In a pestle and mortar or a Flavour Shaker, bash up the dried chillies and coriander seeds and add the ground cinnamon and a good pinch of salt and pepper.",
      "Scoop the seeds out of your squash and put them to one side. Cut the squash into wedges, place them in a roasting tray, and drizzle over enough olive oil just to coat. Sprinkle over the ground spices and give the squash a good toss, spreading the pieces out in one layer.",
      "Once the duck has been in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, add the tray of squash to the oven and roast for about 45 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, rinse the squash seeds after removing any fibres. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Toast them in a dry frying pan until they’re golden and crisp, and put aside.",
      "To make the dressing, put the lime juice and zest into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil, plus the sesame oil and the soy sauce. Stir in the sugar, chilli, garlic, the green spring onion ends and coriander stalks. Taste and adjust the sweet-and-sourness and the seasoning. You want it to be a little limey, to contrast with the rich duck.",
      "After 2 hours, if the duck is nice and crispy, and the squash soft and sticky, take both trays out of the oven. If they need more time, leave them in until perfectly done. Using two forks, shred the duck meat off the bone and put into a large bowl.",
      "While the duck and squash are still warm, toss with the toasted seeds, half the coriander leaves, half the mint and half the white spring onion slices. Pour on the dressing and toss together. Serve sprinkled with the rest of the coriander, mint and white spring onion slices."

      "Put the onions and celery into a food processor with the bacon and thyme leaves and pulse until finely chopped. Put a very large casserole-type pan (roughly 25cm in diameter) on a medium heat, add a good lug of olive oil, then add the allspice, pepper, ground cloves, a good pinch of salt, and grate in the nutmeg. Stir for a few minutes, until it’s smelling fantastic, then tip in everything from the food processor and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the veg are starting to soften.",
      "Cut the steak into roughly 2cm pieces and pulse in a food processor until it looks like mince. Add to the pan of veg, then do the same with the lamb or mutton and the heart. Get rid of any sinewy bits. Halve the kidneys, and quickly rinse them and the livers in a bowl of water. Drain, then pulse in the processor once or twice – don’t purée them! Add to the pan, then cook and stir everything for about 15 minutes, or until the meat starts to colour. At this point, add the bay leaves and 500ml of stock or water, then cover with a lid and leave to blip away on a low heat for around 2 hours, stirring now and then to make sure it doesn’t catch and adding a splash of water if needed.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. After 2 hours, spoon a few ladles of the haggis mixture (avoiding the bay leaves) into the clean food processor and blitz to a fairly smooth consistency. Stir this back in to add a lovely creaminess. Spread the pinhead oats on a baking tray and toast in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until golden. Stir into the haggis mixture, then add the remaining stock. Simmer with the lid off for about another 30 to 35 minutes. This is a great time to cook your neeps and tatties.",
      "Once the time is up, fish out the bay leaves and continue cooking until you’ve got a nice thick consistency. Turn the heat off, then correct the seasoning to push it to the point of perfection. Stir in the whisky, a few gratings of lemon and orange zest and the Worcestershire sauce. Taste and correct the flavours if needed, then put the lid on and leave until you’re ready to serve – preferably with plenty of good friends and a dram or two of fine Scottish whisky.",
      "PS: Put the leftover haggis into an earthenware-type dish and top it off with neeps and tatties. It makes the most exciting sorta-shepherd’s pie."

      "Meanwhile, if you’re making fresh pasta, get on with making your dough. Add the eggs and flour to a food processor with a pinch of salt and whiz until combined. Roll the dough through a pasta machine, starting on the widest setting and working your way down to the second to last. If you don’t have a pasta machine simply divide the pasta into 6 pieces and roll each piece into nice thin sheets using a rolling pin. Once at the right thickness (you’re aiming for slightly thicker than a playing card) roll through the pappardelle cutter or lightly roll in half and over once more, then slice into 2.5cm pieces and toss to separate, dusting with flour to stop it from sticking. Cook the pasta for 2 to 3 minutes in boiling salted water (or if you’re using dried pasta, cook according to packet instructions), then drain, reserving a cupful of the cooking water. Taste and check the ragu seasoning, then mix through the pasta, loosening with a splash of cooking water if needed. Divide between your plates or bowls, and finish with a grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

      "Dad and I had a really interesting conversation about smaller families not wanting whole turkeys for their dinner. So we had a scout around the supermarkets and developed a really delicious and impressive recipe for this. It’s dramatic and stretches the meat a fairly long way. The case of pastry and minced mushrooms keeps the breast moist and delicious and is a little forgiving so the meat holds its juices. You could assemble it a day before and just leave it in the fridge ready to over deliver on Christmas day.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Place the turkey breast upside-down on a board. Gently slice into the natural join of the breast muscle to open it out and make a sort of pocket. Season well and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle over half the thyme leaves, then spread over an even layer of cranberry jam, pushing it into all the nooks and crannies. Fold it back into shape to seal the mixture inside – swiss roll-stylie – and push a few cocktail sticks into the seam to keep it together. Transfer the turkey to a roasting tray, season the outside with the remaining thyme leaves, a good pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Rub it all over, cover in tin foil and roast in the hot oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until just cooked through – using a thermometer, you want it to be 72°C at the thickest point.",
      "Meanwhile, soak the porcini in a dish of just-boiled water. After 5 minutes, stir with a fork so any bits of grit sink to the bottom. Add the bacon to a large frying pan with a splash of oil on a medium heat and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, or until beautifully golden and super crispy. Strip in the leaves from 2 rosemary sprigs for the last 30 seconds or so. Remove everything from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat behind. Add the fresh mushrooms to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper. Drain and chop the porcini, saving the water, then stir into the pan. Add a splash of the water, avoiding the grit, then cook for around 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pan starts to sizzle again and the mushrooms are golden, soft and sticky with caramelly edges.",
      "To make the gravy, cut the thigh off the turkey leg and slash into it slightly. Throw the leg and thigh into a pot along with the carrot, leek and onion. Stir in the flour, add a good pinch of salt and pepper and 2 litres of boiling water. Add a heaped tablespoon of cranberry jam, the balsamic vinegar and remaining rosemary sprig. Bring back to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for around 2 hours, or until thick. Strain it through a sieve and reheat before serving.",
      "When the mushroom pan is dry, add a knob of butter and toss to coat. Tip the mushrooms into the food processor and whiz until you get a good mixture of smooth and chunky. Leave to cool. Once the turkey breast and stuffing have cooled, you can get on with assembling the wellington.",
      "Dust a clean surface with flour, then roll out each packet of puff pastry to the size of a shoe box (one will be the base, one the lid – roll the lid ever so slightly bigger). Line a large roasting tray with greaseproof paper, dust with flour, then add the smaller piece of pastry. Spread half of the mushroom stuffing onto the middle of the base to cover an area the same size as your turkey breast. Remove the cocktail sticks, then place the turkey breast on top and spread the remaining stuffing over the top packing it all in and smoothing it out so that the whole breast is covered. Sprinkle with the crispy bacon and rosemary, then brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Lay the second sheet of pastry over the top, gently mold it round the shape of the breast, pushing all the air out and seal together. Trim the edges to around 4cm, then pull, twist, tuck and pinch in the pastry (like in the picture).",
      "Brush the whole thing with beaten egg then all the hard work’s done. Leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight until you’re ready to cook. On Christmas day, cook at 180°/350°F/gas 4 for 50 to 60 minutes, or until risen, puffy and beautifully golden and the turkey is piping hot throughout. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for around 10 minutes before carving. Serve carved into 2.5cm with the gravy and all the usual. Christmas in a mouthful."

      "Now assemble your Wellington. Roll out the puff pastry on a sheet of baking parchment until it’s about 30cm x 40cm, then spread the mushroom mixture all over it. In a large bowl, lightly toss together the spinach, squash and onion-bread mixture, then spoon it in a thick line down the middle of the pastry. Leave a space free at either side so you can roll the pastry around the filling.",
      "To do this, hold one side of the baking parchment and lift it, with the pastry, towards the centre of the Wellington so it starts to cover the filling. Peel the baking parchment back, leaving the pastry in place, then do the same with the other side. The pastry should overlap in the middle. Beat the egg with the milk and brush it over the pastry join to seal the join. Fold up the ends so the filling doesn’t leak out, then carefully roll the Wellington onto a baking sheet, with the seal underneath. Brush all over with the egg mix.",

      "1 bunch fresh thyme",
      "1 lemon",
      "sea salt",
      "freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 large handful pine nuts",
      "2 large handfuls fresh white breadcrumbs",

      "1 whole higher-welfare chicken , approximately 1.5kg"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "You don’t often see whole chicken that’s been stuffed like this. I think that’s a real shame because it adds such beautiful flavour and the natural juices from the chicken will give you the most gorgeous stuffing.",
      "Preheat your oven to 240°C/475°F/gas 9. Heat a good lug of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add your onion and garlic and cook for about 10 minutes until soft, but not coloured. Add the mushrooms with the leaves from a few of your thyme sprigs. Turn the heat up to high and fry for 5 to 10 minutes until the mushrooms go slightly crispy. Remove from the heat, grate in the zest of the lemon and season well. Tip into a bowl and leave to one side to cool.",
      "Once the mixture has cooled, use clean hands to mix in the pine nuts and breadcrumbs, then add the egg. Carefully, push your fingers between the meat and skin on the top of the chicken then gently create a pocket for the stuffing. Push a quarter of the stuffing into this pocket and roll the remaining mixture into balls and pop to one side. Cut your zested lemon in half and place in the chicken cavity with the remaining thyme sprigs. Pop your chicken in a roasting tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Place in the preheated oven and turn the heat down to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Cook for 40 minutes, then add your mushroom stuffing balls to the tray. Return to the oven and cook for a further 35 minutes until gorgeous and golden. To check your chicken is cooked, stick a skewer into the fattest part of the thigh – if the juices run clear, your chicken is done. Leave to rest for 10 to 15 minutes, covered loosely with tin foil, then serve with fluffy roast potatoes and seasonal greens."

Spoon the vegetables onto a board and roughly chop them, then tip back into the tray and place on a medium heat. Pour in 500ml boiling water and stir well, making sure you scrape up all the lovely sticky goodness from the bottom of the tray.",
      "Drain and roughly chop the peppers, then add them to the tray with the smoked paprika, ground coriander and the couscous. Pull the lemon halves out of the chicken with a pair of tongs and squeeze the juices into the tray (making sure to catch any pips). Bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to rest for 5 minutes, or until the couscous has absorbed all of the water. Meanwhile, pick and finely chop the mint leaves. When the time’s up, fluff up the couscous using a fork and stir through the chopped mint. Drizzle with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and everything together.",
      "Cut the chicken up into joints, removing the skin if you want to keep it healthy, then serve with the tasty roast-vegetable couscous. Enjoy!",

You want to score about 1cm down into them. Not only will this help all the lovely flavours get right into the fish, it will also help it cook more quickly. Season both sides of the fish well and stuff the remaining chopped parsley and the mint leaves into the scores. Mint goes brilliantly with oily fish, such as salmon.",

      "This is a bit of a special weekend dinner and, despite how impressive the stuffed pork looks, it’s honestly not that hard to make. It’s an exciting dish and the end result will definitely blow you away, but you’ll have to take a bit of time with it and show it some love.",
      "You’ll want to buy the pork from a good butcher and ask for a boneless loin of pork with the skin off (but keep it for crackling) and belly on. Keeping the belly on makes stuffing the pork much easier. A nice little tip is to ask your butcher to give you the bones, as these will make a brilliant trivet to roast your meat on.",
      "Preheat your oven to its highest setting. Tear or roughly chop your mushrooms – thick, thin and wonky, it doesn’t matter, you want it chunky and rustic. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, add a lug of olive oil, the thyme leaves and mushrooms, and toss around a bit. Next, add the sliced garlic and knob of butter. Fry everything off for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms are browning a little around the edges. Add the lemon zest with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then remove to a bowl and let it cool. Once cool, add the bread and toss together.",
      "Now turn your attention to the pork. Lay the loin and belly on a board, fatty-side down, and use a knife to make a little pocket between the loin and the belly meat. Stuff the cooled mushroom mixture into the pocket, then season well all over with salt and pepper. If you’ve got any garlicky, thyme and lemon juices left in the pan, pour these over the pork for some wonderful added flavour. Rub all the seasoning and juices into the pork.",
      "Roll the belly around the loin and tie it tightly with 5 or 6 pieces of string to keep it all in place. If your butcher gave you the bones, scatter them around the bottom of an appropriately sized roasting tray – you want the pork to sit quite snugly in the tray - and put the meat on top. Place in the oven and immediately turn it down to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 so the meat cooks through nice and evenly. This is a good time to get the crackling ready for the oven, so score the skin with a small sharp knife to open it up for seasoning. Bash up the fennel seeds and salt in a pestle and mortar, rub a generous amount of this into the skin and place it on a baking tray.",
      "After the meat has had an hour in the oven, take it out and add the chopped vegetables and remaining bulb of garlic to the tray, roughly broken apart into unpeeled cloves. Pour in the glass of cider and give the tray a shake to coat everything. Put it all back in the oven to cook for another hour. The crackling can also go in at this point.",
      "Before the second hour is up, put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Peel and cut the celeriac and potatoes into even-sized chunks, then boil for 12 to 15 minutes until soft and ready to mash. Drain and let them steam-dry, then return to the pan with a good knob of butter, some seasoning and the milk. Mash until smooth, adding a splash more milk if you need it. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.",
      "When the pork is ready, remove it from the oven on to a plate and cover with tin foil, so it can rest for about 20 minutes while you crack on with the gravy. You’ll have some nice roasted root veg and sticky goodness left in the bottom of the tray. Pour or spoon off the excess fat in the tray, then place it over a very low heat and pour in the stock a little at a time (you may not need to use all of it), using a potato masher as you go to mash up all the vegetables. Keep stirring to make sure you get all the lovely sticky brown bits off the bottom of the tray. Add the flour and keep reducing the gravy down until you get the consistency you like. Pass the gravy through a sieve to get rid of any lumps, then serve with the warm mash, stuffed pork and beautiful crackling."

      "Meanwhile, cut the root vegetables into large, even-sized chips. Parboil the potatoes and carrots for 6 minutes in salted, boiling water and, after 3 minutes, add the sweet potatoes. Drain in a colander and allow to steam dry for a few minutes. Spread the chips on a baking sheet in a single layer, drizzle with a little olive oil and lightly season with salt. Toss lightly and, when the chicken has been in the oven for half an hour, slide in the baking sheet so the chicken and vegetables can roast together for the final 45 minutes.",
      "Lay out your bacon rashers and glide over them with the back of your knife to stretch them a little – this will prevent them from shrinking when they cook. Wrap each chipolata with a bacon rasher, then thread 2 chipolatas on to each skewer in little U-shapes. After the chicken has had 45 minutes in the oven, take it out and arrange the sausage skewers around it.

      "This recipe may sound like a lot of work, but curing your own salmon is much easier than you think. You do need to plan ahead, as the flavours need about two days to sink into the salmon properly, but it’s worth the wait.",
      "You’ll only spend about 20 minutes doing the actual curing, and you’ll end up with a delicate pink gravadlax which tastes impressive. Although curing is easy, it is important to follow the measurements, so try to get a side of salmon as close as possible to the weight I’ve suggested here. For the first cure, blitz the beetroots, orange and lemon zest, and bashed juniper berries in a food processor until you get a fairly smooth paste. Transfer this to a bowl and stir in the rock salt and sugar. Pour in the gin and give it a good mix.",
      "Lay the side of salmon skin-side down on a large baking tray and slowly pour over the beetroot cure. Use a spatula to spread it all over the salmon flesh. Once it is all well covered, wrap the salmon in a double layer of greaseproof paper then wrap it tightly with cling film and place it in the fridge for 24 hours.",
      "The next day, take the salmon out of the fridge and carefully unwrap it so you can rinse off the cure. Either use 100ml of cold water or gin. Hold the salmon over a baking tray and pour a splash at a time over your salmon. Use a spoon to gently push the beetroot cure off the fish. By now it should have shared its wonderful flavours with the fish and turned it a really vibrant colour. Put the rinsed salmon to one side and run the tray under the tap.",
      "For the second cure, mix together the chopped herbs, grated horseradish and gin. Put the salmon back into the clean tray, skin-side down, and pack the herby cure onto the salmon using your hands. Make sure you cover all the flesh – you don’t want any air getting to it. Wrap it again with a double layer of greaseproof paper, then a tight layer of cling film. Pop the salmon back in the fridge for another 24 hours.",
      "The next day your salmon will be perfectly cured and ready to eat. You don’t need to rinse off that second cure – simply slice the salmon as finely as you can on an angle so you get gorgeous thin slices of gravadlax tinged with pink and topped with herbs. Pile these onto a plate and serve with a couple of slices of buttered brown bread, and some watercress and wedges of lemon."

      "Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas mark 4. Tear the ciabatta into rough pieces and place in a baking tray. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Pop in the oven and cook for 10 minutes until you’ve got crispy, golden croutons.",
      "Put all the salad leaves in a big bowl. Finely slice the celery at an angle and add it to the bowl of salad with the celery leaves.",
      "Heat a frying pan on a medium heat. Split the black puddings lengthways, tear them open, crumble into the frying pan and fry until crispy. Don’t be scared if it looks very black and almost burnt - trust me, it will taste delicious. Once ready, remove to a plate and keep warm.",
      "Carefully slice the scallops in half so you have 2 rounds from each scallop and score them on one side with a little criss-cross. Season with a little salt and pepper and a sprinkling of lemon zest. Sear for a minute in a frying pan, scored-side down, with a touch of olive oil, and don’t be tempted to touch them! Add the roe to the pan now, too. After a minute, check the underside, and continue to fry until lovely and caramelised. Turn them over and allow the other side to do the same. Be careful not to overcook them though, a minute or so on each side is all they need.",
      "Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter, then nestle the lovely scallops in among them. Sprinkle over that wonderful, crispy black pudding and the croutons. Snip the salad cress over the top, and finish with a good squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. What an amazing treat!"

You want it to be quite coarse so just pulse it a few times, then tip it into your bowl of herbs along with the chopped olives and lemon zest.

In Italy, they’ll start basting the lamb after 30 minutes by pouring a swig of wine over the meat and veg every 15 minutes or so until the meat is cooked. Trust me – it is well worth doing and makes it juicy and delicious! When cooked, transfer the lamb to a board or platter to rest while you make your gravy.",

      "The thing about risottos is that you can never have enough combinations, and just when you think you’ve done them all you come up with a new one that hits the spot. The use of vodka instead of wine leaves you with a fragrant freshness when the risotto is cooked, which marries fantastically well with smoky flakes of haddock and the al dente crunch of fine yellow beans. As there is fish in this risotto you don’t want to include any Parmesan, so bear this in mind. If you’re a risotto fan you’ve got to give this a try. Start your basic risotto, adding the vodka at Stage 2 instead of the wine. Then lightly poach your haddock in the milk and stock from the basic recipe with a couple of bay leaves, covered with a lid. Simmer for around 5 minutes and remove from the heat. At Stage 3 of the basic recipe, I like to add the poaching liquor to the rice and then I carry on as normal through the recipe. At the end of Stage 3 flake in your smoked haddock, add the beans and carry on as normal through to the end of the recipe. Don’t serve with any Parmesan sprinkled over – serve sprinkled with the celery leaves. Add a dash of vodka and a squeeze of lemon to lift the flavours. Lovely."

      "The Navajo love their lamb and mutton, but back in the day – at the right times of the year – they’d also get out there and hunt things like elk, which they’d stew with wild juniper berries. What’s amazing for me is that thousands of miles away in Britain we were hunting deer for venison and stewing that with juniper too. I guess some combos are just brilliant, no matter where you live. Don’t worry if you can’t get venison, because stewing beef will also be delicious. Really nice served with some rice, beans, a jacket potato or flatbreads, or, if you’re a bit more traditional, some nice steamed greens. A humble but delicious stew.",

Add your chopped onions, carrots, celery, crushed juniper berries, rosemary and the knob of butter. Add a few tablespoons of water, give everything a good stir, then pop the lid on the pan and let everything steam for 4 to 5 minutes so the flavours really mingle together.",
      "Take the lid off so your meat and veg start to fry, and stir every so often for 5 to 10 minutes. Chop your parsley stalks finely, and once the onions start to caramelize, add them to the pan with your remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and your crumbled stock cubes. Stir, and pour in enough water to cover the mixture by a couple of inches. Put the parsley leaves aside for later.",

Add your potatoes and slow cook for at least 2 hours with the lid slightly askew, or until the meat falls apart easily. Keep an eye on it as it cooks, and add splashes of water if you think it looks too dry.",
      "Put your chopped garlic in the middle of a chopping board. Add most of your parsley leaves with a teaspoon of sea salt and half a teaspoon of black pepper. Chop everything together so you get a kinda chunky paste. Add this to the stew and stir through. Chop the last of your parsley leaves and sprinkle over before serving."

      "This is dead simple, completely versatile and absolutely gorgeous. It’s not a pretty-boy pie; it’s a proper, old-school pie that everyone will be over the moon to see on the table. I’m putting leftover white turkey meat to good use here, but you could also mix brown meat in there too.",
      "Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Put your bacon in a large pan on a medium heat and add your thyme leaves. Add a lug of olive oil and let it all fry off a few minutes. Add all of your prepped leeks and fry them off for about 3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and pepper then pop the lid on top, turn the heat down to medium and let them cook away gently for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure they don’t catch. There’s going to be enough moisture in the leeks to keep them happy in the pan so they should be soft and melt in your mouth once they’re done.",
      "When your leeks are ready, add the turkey meat to them and stir. If you’ve got a bit of stuffing mixed in there you can put that in too. Add the flour, mix it in well then pour in your stock and stir again. Add the crème fraîche then turn the heat up and bring everything back up to the boil. Have a taste and add a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it then turn the heat off. Pour the mixture through a sieve over another large empty pan and let the wonderful gravy from the mixture drip into the pan while you roll out your pastry.",
      "Get a deep baking dish roughly 22 x 30cm. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with a bit of flour and roll your pastry out so it’s about double the size of your dish. Crumble the chestnuts over one half of the pastry then tear a few of the sage leaves over the chestnuts. Fold the other half of pastry on top then roll it out carefully and evenly so you have a rectangle big enough to cover your baking tray. Don’t worry if a few bits stick out here and there.",
      "Spoon that thick leek mixture from your sieve into the pie dish and spread it out evenly. Lay your pastry on top, tuck the ends under then gently score the pastry diagonally with your knife. Add a pinch of salt to your beaten egg then paint this egg wash over the top of your pastry. Pop your pie in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown. When the pie is ready, re-heat the lovely gravy and serve with your pie, along with some peas tossed in butter, lemon, salt and pepper and everyone’s happy!"

Mix together a pinch of salt and pepper with the zest of one lemon and the juice of half of it, then spoon a little of this into the middle of the soup. When you go to eat it, stir it in and it gives a wonderful flavour. Other things you can consider are little slices of grilled crostini put into the bottom of the bowls before the soup is poured over. Or you could even quickly fry some nice-looking mushrooms – like girolles, chanterelles or oysters – and sprinkle these on top of the soup.

If you’re buying from a small producer, like the lovely turkey I used from my mate Paul Kelly, you’ll often find these birds come with their own cooking instructions. Really good-quality birds do cook in a shorter time so follow the instructions if it has them.",
      "This year I’m using a flavoured butter to give a bit of extra love to my turkey, and this is a job you can do the day before. Get your turkey and use a spoon to work your way between the skin and the meat. Start at the side of the cavity just above the leg and work gently up towards the breastbone and towards the back so you create a large cavity. Pick up half of your butter and push it into the cavity you’ve created. Use your hands to push it through the skin right to the back so it coats the breast meat as evenly as possible. Do the same on the other side then rub any leftover butter all over the outside of the bird to use it up. If you’ve got any herb stalks left over, put them in the cavity of the turkey for added flavour as it cooks. Cover the turkey in cling film and keep in the fridge until you need it.",
      "Take your turkey out of the fridge a few hours before you are ready to put it in the oven so it has time to come up to room temperature. That flavoured butter will already be under the skin so you’ll only need a few tweaks to finish it off. Halve the clementines and pop them in the cavity with a few more sprigs of fresh herbs like rosemary, bay and thyme. The fruit will steam and flavour the birds in a really lovely way. Take the fresh rosemary, pull off the leaves at the bottom then spear that through the loose skin around the cavity to hold it together and keep it from shrinking back as the turkey cooks.",
      "Open up the neck cavity and pack as much stuffing as possible in there, then carefully pull the skin back over the cavity, tuck it under the bird and pop it in the roasting tray. If you’ve already made your gravy like I’ve done, you won’t need a vegetable trivet, if not, do that now by roughly chopping the carrots, onions and celery sticks. Preheat your oven to full whack, get the turkey in the roasting tray and cover with foil. As soon as it goes in the oven, immediately turn the heat down to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.",
      "As a rough guide, you want to cook the turkey for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilogram, so a 7kg turkey will want about 4 to 4½ hours in the oven. But there are so many variables such as the sort of oven you have and the quality of your bird. Check on your turkey every 30 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 3½ hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. If you are at all worried just stick a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast. When the internal temperature has reached 65ºC for a good quality bird, and about 82ºC for a cheaper bird, it’s ready to come out.",
      "Carefully put a metal skewer in the cavity and use it to lift the bird and angle it over the roasting tray so all of the juices from the cavity run out. Move the turkey to a platter then cover it with a double layer of tinfoil and 2 tea towels to keep it warm while it rests for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours for bigger birds."

      "Just about everyone I know is a fan of meatballs, so I thought I’d give you a recipe for these as they are something a little different. I’ve seen them made in Sicily in the same way, using a mixture of swordfish and tuna – not jarred or tinned tuna though. These have to be made with fresh fish and they are subtly seasoned with Sicilian herbs and spices – this recipe is just as good as the meat versions!",
      "First make your sauce. Place a large pan on the heat, add a good lug of olive oil, your onion and garlic and fry slowly for 10 or so minutes until soft. Add your oregano, the tomatoes, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 minutes or so, then liquidize until smooth. Taste – it might need a tiny swig of red wine vinegar or some extra seasoning.",
      "While the tomatoes are simmering, chop the tuna up into 2.5cm/1 inch dice. Pour a good couple of tablespoons of olive oil into a large frying pan and place on the heat. Add the tuna to the pan with the pine nuts and cinnamon. Season lightly with salt and pepper and fry for a minute or so to cook the tuna on all sides and toast the pine nuts. Remove from the heat and put the mixture into a bowl. Allow to cool down for 5 minutes, then add the oregano, parsley, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, eggs, and zest and juice of the lemon to the bowl. Using your hands, really scrunch and mix the flavours into the tuna, then divide the mixture and squeeze it into meatballs slightly smaller than a golf ball. If you dip one of your hands in water while shaping you’ll get a nice smooth surface on the meatball. If the mixture’s very sticky, add a few more breadcrumbs. Keep the meatballs around the same size and place them on an oiled tray, then put them in the fridge for an hour to let them rest.",
      "Put the pan you fried the tuna in back on the heat with a little olive oil. Add your meatballs to the pan and jiggle them about until they’re golden brown all over. You might want to do them in batches – when they’re done, add them to the tomato sauce, divide between your plates, sprinkle with chopped parsley and drizzle with good olive oil. Great served with spaghetti or linguine."

      "I have to be honest – once you’ve eaten pork in Italy you have to really look around for anything as fine over here. You see, we’ve become attracted to breeds of pigs that grow very fast to be butchered and sold on ASAP, whereas our old farming methods used breeds that are now considered rare. They take longer to grow to maturity, which gives the meat a fantastic depth of flavour and plenty of snowy white, waxy fat that just melts in the pan. Once you’ve tried that, everything else comes second best.",
      "Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Parboil your potatoes in salted boiling water for around 15 minutes until tender, then drain. Score the pork skin, season it and put it in a hot roasting tray with a drizzle of olive oil. As it begins to crisp up, add your potatoes and thyme. Toss once or twice (making sure the crackling ends up on top of the potatoes so it crisps up even more) and put in the oven for around 15 minutes until cooked.",
      "Meanwhile, pound up your fennel seeds and bay leaves in a pestle and mortar with 2 tablespoons of salt until you have a fine green moist paste. Shake this through a sieve into a bowl – this will stop it from sticking together in lumps. Pat your pork chops with a little oil – this will stop them sticking to the pan. Season the pork chops on both sides with the herb salt and keep any excess to use another day. Preheat your griddle pan until really hot. Don’t add any extra oil to the pan – if you do it will start to smoke. Add your pork chops, and cook for around 3-4 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the pork. Try to avoid the temptation to overcook them. Once cooked allow to rest for about 4 minutes.",
      "Heat a little pan and add the cider and mustard. Bring to the boil, then reduce by half and add the crème fraîche. Bring back to the boil and reduce again until the sauce thickens, then remove from the heat. Add the butter and shake the pan around a bit so the sauce thickens and shines. Season to taste.",
      "Serve up the potatoes – I like to bash up half of them so they kind of smash and crumble – with the pork, a lovely piece of crackling and any resting juices from the meat. Drizzle over the cider sauce and eat – what a pleasure. Nice with a simple green salad and a pint of cider."

Add the cream, allow to simmer gently for a couple more minutes and then remove the pan from the heat. Season the sauce carefully with salt, pepper and the lemon juice.",
      "Put the pasta into the boiling water — fresh will need only 3 minutes and dried will need to be cooked according to the packet instructions. If your sauce has cooled down then reheat it now. When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander and then toss with the parsley in the pan in which it was cooked. Check the seasoning, then divide on to your serving plates with the sauce on top. Serve straight away, telling your guests to stir the pasta up in their bowls every so often to keep the pasta moist.",

Drain, and then prick the lemons all over with a knife. (The reason for doing this is that you are going to put them inside the chicken and their wonderful juices will be released while cooking. They will burst with flavour and fragrance, and the heat from the lemons will help the chicken to cook quicker from the inside as well as making it taste and smell amazing.) Remove the parsley leaves from the stalks and put to one side. Stuff the chicken with your hot lemons and the parsley stalks. Then season the chicken and the potatoes with a tiny pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper, and slice your chorizo at an angle, 0.5cm/¼ inch thick.",
      "Get yourself an appropriately sized baking tray. Take a piece of greaseproof paper and wet it under a tap so it becomes flexible, then shake it out and lay it into the baking tray. Place the potatoes into the centre of the greaseproof paper, then place the chicken on top and sprinkle with the chorizo and a little of your chopped parsley. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Cook in the preheated oven for around 1 hour 20 minutes.",
      "While the chicken and potatoes are cooking you can make what the Italians call gremolata, by finely chopping the zest of your 2 remaining lemons and mixing it with the chopped parsley and garlic. Season with a little pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss together to create a really fragrant seasoning-type garnish. Remove the tray from the oven, take the chicken out and put to one side to rest. Give the potatoes a shake about and put them back in the oven for a few minutes to crisp up.",
      "Carve the chicken and divide between 8 plates, with the potatoes. The potatoes will have taken on the smoky paprika flavour from the chorizo, so if there is any juice left over in the tray, pour every last drop over the plates. When you sprinkle over the gremolata it will hit the hot juice and smell fantastic. You're going to love this one! A rocket salad goes really well with it."

Make two of these then lay them opened and flat on your table. Each foil wrap will hold one piece of fish – you can do a big one for four or a slightly smaller version for two.",
      "In a pestle and mortar, bash your lime leaves until they break down and all the flavour comes out. Then add the lemon grass and do the same again. Do this for a couple of minutes... it’s worth every second. Then add the garlic, chilli, grated ginger and all of the coriander stalks. Once this is all smashed to a pulp, add the soy sauce, the lime zest and juice and the olive old. Mix well, then taste and correct the seasoning with extra soy sauce as you see fit.",
      "Lightly score the sea bass on the skin side with a sharp knife and then rub them with the lime-ginger-lemon grass mix. Allow to marinate for an hour, if you have time, or you can cook it all straight away.",
      "Lightly brush the foil edges with a little beaten egg white – this helps to seal the parcel when you fold it up and keeps all the flavoured steam inside to cook the fish.",
      "Put the portions of sea bass, skin-side up on one side of each envelope. Divide the marinade and all the juice between the two packages and tuck some coriander into the slits of each piece of fish. Fold over the foil, then fold up two sides of the envelopes securely. Just before you seal the final side of the foil bags, divide the sake between the two envelopes, taking care so that it doesn’t dribble out. Pucker and bend the folded sides up so that the juices can’t cook out. Don’t fold the foil right up to the edge of the fish – leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space all round the fillets to let the steam circulate.",
      "I know all this sounds like a bit of a palaver, but it’s actually dead simple.",
      "Place straight on to the hot tray and cook for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Once cooked, allow to sit for 2–3 minutes. Serve the bags at the table – just cut them open and carefully lift out the fish. You can spoon the juices over it (but don’t eat the bits from the marinade as they’re really only there for flavour).",
      "I like to serve this with a bowl of coriander-flavoured rice or noodles, cooked simply. You’re going to love it."

      "You will need a large casserole or stock pot to fit your chicken in so that you can cover it with water by about 2.5cm. Stuff the chicken with the parsley and bay leaves, then add your chicken to the pot, cover with water and add a good teaspoon of salt. Scatter in the potatoes, bring to the boil, then turn down, place a lid on top and simmer for about 20 minutes. At this point you can add your baby carrots, turnips or radishes and fennel. Carry on simmering for 30 to 40 minutes.",
      "When you can easily pull the leg bone away from the chicken, you know that it's cooked to perfection. By that time the other veg will certainly be cooked, but don't break them up. Now... while this is all cooking, you can prepare your horseradish cream – the most joyous thing to have with the chicken. In your supermarket you will be able to find creamed or hot grated horseradish in a jar, which is OK to use, but if you're really lucky you'll be able to get hold of some fresh horseradish which you can simply peel and grate, season with salt and mix with the crème fraîche. (I'm lucky because my local supermarket sells them whole – just ask at yours if there are none in stock.)",
      "All you have to do now is carefully remove the chicken to a bowl and add the peas, broad beans and spinach to the broth. Allow them to cook for one minute, then season carefully to taste. You can get all your guests to help themselves if that's easier, but if you want to serve it up, divide a nice mixture of veg between 6 bowls, put some shredded chicken on top, then ladle over some of the wonderful, comforting broth. Sprinkle over some of the chopped reserved fennel tops or some celery leaves, with a healthy dollop of horseradish crème fraîche on top and a drizzle of nice peppery olive oil – it will look and taste brilliant."

A minestrone can also be a whole meal if you want it to be, with pasta, stale bread or rice to bulk it out.

Remove them to a plate and then fry off the onion, garlic and celery in the pan. Add the butter and spare flour and continue to fry for about 4 minutes, scraping off any goodness that is on the bottom of the pan. Add your 2 glasses of white wine and allow the liquid to reduce by half, then put the chickens back into the pan. Now pour in your stock – it should come to about half-way up the chickens. Make yourself a cartouche. Wet it so it's flexible then tuck this in and around the pan.",
      "Place in the oven and cook for around 50 minutes to an hour until the chickens have crisp skin and the thigh meat falls off the bone. Remove the chicken to some nice serving bowls – ones that can hold a bit of sauce – and place your pan back on the hob. Add the lettuces, grapes, parsley leaves and tarragon leaves and simmer for a couple more minutes. Correct the seasoning carefully and spoon this sauce next to the chicken."

Peel and chop the garlic, quarter the tomatoes and get your wine ready.",
      "Add the pasta to the boiling water with a good pinch of salt and cook according to packet instructions until al dente. About 5 minutes before your pasta is ready, get ready to start cooking – you'll have to be quick about this, so no mucking about! Put 4 generous lugs of extra virgin olive oil into the hot pan and add the garlic, parsley stalks and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Crumble in the dried chilli and add the chopped tomatoes. Stir everything around constantly and just as the garlic starts to colour, tip in the clams and pour in the wine. It will splutter and steam, so give everything a good shake and put the lid on the pan. After about 3 or 4 minutes the clams will start to open, so keep shuffling the pan around until all of them have opened. Take the pan off the heat. Get rid of any clams that haven't opened.",
      "By now your pasta should be just about perfect. Drain and add to the pan of clams along with the parsley leaves and an extra drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Stir or toss for a further minute or two to let the beautiful seashore juices from the clams be absorbed into the pasta. Serve right away. No sane Italian would eat this dish without some fresh hunks of bread to mop up the juices. Beautiful!",
      "PS The first time you make this it will be good, but you might find things don't come together exactly at the right time. But don't worry, this dish is all about confidence and the more you make this, the more you'll find the pasta and clams are ready and perfect at the same time. And then it will be great!"

Warm your flatbreads in the oven or in a hot dry pan while your kebabs are cooking.",

Roll up your mint leaves, finely slice them and add to the bowl along with the dill.

      "Jamie’s top tips\n• Look out for ground beef with around 10% fat – if buying turkey, try to buy the best quality you can afford. Don’t buy poor-quality turkey mince. If your grocery store has a meat counter you can ask them to grind the meat for you.\n• This can be made completely ahead of time and reheated just before serving. If you’re reheating Sloppy Joes, add water a little bit at a time to loosen.\n• If you want to give it a bit of a kick add some more chile powder or even a chopped fresh chile.",
      "Tips from the dietitian:\n• Sloppy Joe is a real favorite, but for a healthier version, use lean ground turkey instead of beef – the leaner meat is better for the heart.\n• Rinsing beans removes some of the salt but you can also look for low-sodium or no-salt-added beans."

Boil your spuds until cooked, then drain and put to one side to cool. Slice them up roughly. Peel back the artichoke leaves, remove the chokes with a teaspoon, then rub the artichokes with lemon juice to stop them discolouring and slice very finely. Put the artichokes and potatoes in a bowl with the melted butter, thyme, parsley and capers and season well. Toss together and divide between the bags. There'll be a little butter left over in the bottom of the bowl, so you can add a little olive oil to it and use this to rub on to the skate pieces.",

Add a glass of wine to each bag with a sprig of rosemary, tightly sealing the final side and pulling up the corners so that the liquid is contained. Bake on a roasting tray in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. By this time the bags will be beautifully puffed up. Serve at the table so that your guests can open their bags themselves, leaving a plate of really flavoursome vegetables, fish and juice.

      "I came up with this recipe when I was in Wales, which produces some of the best lamb in the world. Ask your butcher for extra long lamb cutlets, untrimmed, so you have big Captain Caveman style chops to gnaw on. Marinate the lamb overnight if you can, to really intensify the flavours, which are inspired by the amazing Yemeni cooks I met in the old Tiger Bay community near the docks in Cardiff. Their community has been there for over 200 years, ever since the coal boom of the industrial revolution brought their ancestors to Wales. Their food hasn’t become famous in the same way other cuisines have. But it should have. It’s some of the most exciting food I’ve seen in a long time.",
      "Pound the marinade spices, chillies and garlic to a paste using a pestle and mortar, add a good pinch of salt and pepper, then muddle in just enough olive oil to make the mixture nice and loose. Get a roasting tray, put in the cutlets and rub the marinade all over them. Cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge, or to one side if you’re cooking right away.",
      "Now get all your little dips ready. Put the nuts, sesame seeds, cumin and a pinch of salt into a dry frying pan and toast for a few minutes, tossing occasionally. Once golden, tip them into the mortar and pound up a few times until fine and crunchy, then pour them into a little bowl. Coarsely grate the cucumber on a box grater, then transfer it to a bowl, squeezing out any excess liquid. Finely chop the mint and add it to the bowl with the yoghurt, a good pinch of salt and pepper, and a good squeeze of lemon juice. Stir, then put into a little bowl next to the toasted nuts.",
      "Halve the tomatoes and rub each half, cut side down, on the finer side of the grater so you end up with a fresh tomato slurry. Discard the skins, then finely grate in half the chilli. Season with salt and pepper, stir in a squeeze of lemon juice, sprinkle over some coriander leaves, and crumble over a little feta. Have a taste, adjust if you want it a bit spicier, or saltier, then put it into a little bowl next to the other dips.",
      "Heat a griddle pan on a high heat and cook the lamb cutlets for around 4 minutes on each side, standing them on their fatty sides for a minute or two extra to crisp up. Once they are sizzling and golden, they’re done. Pile them on a board, then get stuck in and encourage everyone to dunk the chops in the dips and some of the based up nuts. Lovely with flatbreads or rice."

Add the hot sausage meatballs and toss everything together. The egg will cook delicately from the heat of the linguine, just enough for it to thicken and not scramble. The sauce should be smooth and silky. If the pasta becomes a little claggy, add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water to loosen it slightly.

My mother's initial reaction was, ‘My God, that's a lot of garlic, you'll stink!’ but don't let the amount put you off, as when garlic is roasted in its skin the pungent flavour is replaced by a jammy sweetness which is divine.",

Meanwhile, take a large pot and slowly fry the white onion in 4 tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes until really soft and translucent. Add the cream and the stock, bring back to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, awaiting your garlic. Remove the garlic from the oven and allow to cool slightly before squeezing out all the sweet, golden paste. Whisk this into the soup. Discard the garlic skins.",
      "Remove the crusts from your ciabatta, rip up the bread into small pieces and throw into the soup. Add the sherry vinegar, then allow the soup to simmer for 5 more minutes. Whiz it until smooth in your food processor with your toasted almonds. Season nicely to taste and serve in big bowls sprinkled with some orange segments, torn up coriander and mint, and drizzled with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil.",
      "Try this: You can eat this cold in the summer – it's obviously going to be thick, which I think is a nice thing, but you can thin it with a little milk or stock if you want to.",

      "Return the pan of oil to a high heat, and once its screaming hot, add the beef. Sear it for 1 to 1½ minutes, so it browns, then turn it over and do the same on the other side. Remember you’re just searing it to get a bit of colour on the outside, not cooking it – it should be blue in the middle.",

      "With a really sharp knife, slice the beef up as thinly as you can without hacking it up or ruining it! Go thicker to do it nicely if you need to. Use the back of a knife to carefully flatten out each slice of beef, then transfer them to a large platter.",
      "Sprinkle with a little salt, as the seasoning won’t have got through to the centre of the beef. Arrange the squash pieces over the top, then crumble over the roasted chestnuts and scatter over the seeds.",
      "Drizzle everything with a bit dressing (save any leftovers for another day), then lightly dress the salad leaves and pop these on the top. Take it to the table with a block of Parmesan for shaving over."

    "instructions": [
      "Carrots and beets are particularly good when roasted as it brings out their natural sugars. The best advice I can give you is about flavouring them. A few smashed garlic cloves, a woody herb like rosemary, thyme, sage or bay, and a splash of vinegar, or squeezed lemon or orange juice, can accentuate their natural flavour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Put your carrots into a large pot and your beets into another, and add enough water to cover them. Season with salt and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until just tender, then drain and place in separate bowls. Peel your beets, and cut any larger carrots and beets in half or into quarters. Smaller ones can stay whole.",
      "Now add your flavourings while the veg are still hot. Toss the carrots with half the smashed garlic and a lug of olive oil, then lightly season. Add the orange juice and the thyme leaves and toss again. Mix the beets with the rest of the garlic, the rosemary, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper. You can now put the veg either into separate ovenproof dishes, or together on a large roasting tray with the carrots in one half of the tray and the beets in the other. Place in middle of the preheated oven and roast for around half an hour or until golden.",
      "While the carrots and beets are cooking, lay the pork chops on a board and score through the skin and the streaky-looking part of the meat. This will give you lovely crackling. Look at the picture – you’ll see what I mean. Firmly press a sage leaf on to the eye meat on both sides of each chop. Season with salt and pepper.",
      "When the vegetables start to colour, heat a large ovenproof frying pan or small roasting tray on the hob, add a good lug of olive oil and put in the chops. As soon as you’ve got nice colour on one side, turn the chops over and place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the chops are crisp on the outside and just cooked through and juicy in the middle. Remove the chops to a warmed plate. Pour most of the fat away from the tray and add a squeeze of lemon juice to it. Stir and scrape the lovely sticky bits off the bottom and drizzle all over the chops. Remove the carrots and beets from the oven – they should be nice and sticky by now. Serve them with the chops and a glass of wine."

      "Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Carefully cut your butternut squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Put these to one side. Cut the squash lengthways into 0.5cm/¼ inch slices. Bash up your coriander and chillies with a pinch of salt and pepper in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Dust this over your squash with a tablespoon of olive oil. Toss around until completely coated. Line up snugly in a roasting tray and bake for around 30 minutes until the flesh and skin are soft to the touch. Now get all your ingredients ready and start making your basic risotto.",
      "Remove the squash from the oven and lay your pancetta over it. Mix the squash seeds, chestnuts and sage leaves with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the squash and pancetta and place back in the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes until the pancetta is crisp.",
      "Once the squash has cooled down a little, shake off the pancetta and chestnuts and finely chop the squash – it will be quite mushy but that’s fine. I go for half of it fine and half chunky. Add this to the risotto at the end of Stage 3.

      "Roast chicken remains one of our favourite dishes at home. I recently discovered a way to make the chicken taste even better, by putting a lemon in with my potatoes when I was parboiling them. It smelt fantastic and flavoured the potatoes. Then when I was draining them I decided to stab the lemon, which hissed out juice and steam, and quickly jammed it inside the chicken! The benefits of the hot steaming lemon going into the chicken are very obvious as the meat tastes amazing, and the chicken cooks slightly quicker because of it.",
      "Rub the chicken inside and out with a generous amount of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Do this in the morning if possible, then cover the chicken and leave in the fridge until you're ready to start cooking it for lunch or dinner. By doing this, you'll make the meat really tasty when cooked. Preheat your oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cut the potatoes into golf-ball-sized pieces, put them into the water with the whole lemon and the garlic cloves, and cook for 12 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 minute (this will give you crispier potatoes), then remove the lemon and garlic. Toss the potatoes in the pan while still hot so their outsides get chuffed up and fluffy – this will make them lovely and crispy when they roast.",
      "While the lemon is still hot, carefully stab it about 10 times. Take the chicken out of the fridge, pat it with kitchen paper and rub it all over with olive oil. Push the garlic cloves, the whole lemon and the thyme into the cavity, then put the chicken into a roasting tray and cook in the preheated oven for around 45 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate. Some lovely fat should have cooked out of it into the roasting tray, so toss the potatoes into this with the rosemary leaves. Shake the tray around, then make a gap in the centre of the potatoes and put the chicken back in. If using the bacon, lay the rashers over the chicken breast and cook for a further 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked and the potatoes are nice and golden. (You can tell the chicken is cooked when the thigh meat pulls easily away from the bone and the juices run clear.)",
      "I like to remove the bacon from the chicken and crumble it up over the potatoes. Then I remove the lemon and garlic from inside the chicken, squeeze all the garlic flesh out of the skin, mush it up and smear it all over the chicken, discard the lemon and rosemary and carve the chicken at the table. Heaven!"

With spices, seeds, yoghurt and a delicious citrus dressing, you’ve got a winner.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Parboil your carrots in boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, until they are very nearly cooked, then drain and put them into a roasting tray. You should flavour them while they’re steaming hot, so while the carrots are cooking get a pestle and mortar and smash up the cumin seeds, chillies, salt and pepper. Add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste. The idea here is to build up the flavours. Add enough extra virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar. This will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! Stir together, then pour over the carrots in the tray, coating them well. Add the orange and lemon halves, cut-side down. These will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing. Place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden. While the carrots are roasting, halve and peel your avocados, discarding the stones, then cut them into wedges lengthways and place in a big bowl. Remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados. Carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar. Season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados. Mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning. Call your gang round the table while you toast or griddle your ciabatta slices.",
      "Tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado. Mix together, toss in the salad leaves and cress and transfer to a big platter or divide between individual plates.

      "I think this is the best macaroni cheese recipe ever (even though it's a bit naughty)! I've used sweet tomatoes in my recipe as they really complement the cheese, and instead of béchamel sauce I've used single cream as it's a lot lighter. I've also topped the dish off with cheesy breadcrumbs, which give it a wonderful crunch. I think you'll laugh when you see how easy it is to make. I put it together extremely quickly by using my Magimix food processor. Don't worry if you haven't got one – you can chop it all up by hand instead and then mix it in a bowl.",
      "Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Get a pan of salted boiling water going and cook your macaroni according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, break your bread up, place it in the food processor and whiz it up to form breadcrumbs. Set aside. Wash your tomatoes and place them in the food processor with the garlic, basil, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Whiz up for 30 seconds. Then add 2 handfuls of the Parmesan, the cream, vinegar and grated nutmeg. Whiz until smooth and season carefully to taste so it's really yummy!",
      "By this time your macaroni will probably be cooked, so drain it in a colander, saving some of the cooking water. Place the pasta back into the pan and pour over every last bit of the cheesy sauce. You want it to be quite loose because you'll be surprised how quickly the sauce will disappear inside the macaroni and will look dry. So add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water. Now you need to get yourself a baking dish about 8–10cm deep – this could be an earthenware dish or even a shallow ovenproof pan. Pour the pasta straight into your baking dish and break the mozzarella into little pieces over the top. Mix the last handful of Parmesan with the thyme leaves and breadcrumbs and sprinkle evenly over the top of the dish. Drizzle generously with good extra virgin olive oil – this will give you a lovely crunch topping.",
      "Place in the preheated oven for 20–25 minutes or until piping hot and golden on top. Serve straight away, sprinkled with a little extra Parmesan. Best eaten with a nice salad – and you'll love it."

      "I think this is a really simple way to make a lovely flatfish like flounder, lemon sole, plaice, turbot or brill look, and taste, really exciting. If you want to, you can ask your fishmonger to run a knife down the back of the fish and make a pocket for you to stuff. If not, it’s dead easy to do at home. If you need some guidance, check out a video of how to stuff a flatfish. Once you’ve tried it this way you can stuff the fish with whatever you fancy: lobster or crabmeat, small fish, herbs, tomatoes . . . just let your imagination go wild! Getting a nice big fish isn’t hard, but you might want to order it in advance from your fishmonger. It’s equally delicious with individual portions though, so look at this as a principle as well as a recipe.",
      "Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. If you look at the head and the tail of your fish, more often than not there’s a secret line between them that the Big Man upstairs has drawn. Using this as your guide, carefully cut into one side of the line near the head, push down gently, angle the tip-end of your knife towards the bone and score between the flesh and the bone to peel away that beautiful fish fillet. Run the knife down to just above the tail and part the fillet from the bone – about 4 to 5cm deep on both sides. Even if you don’t get it perfect, you’ll be stuffing this pocket with prawns so no one will know if your knife work was a bit shabby.",
      "Get a roasting tray that snugly fits your fish and sprinkle your finely sliced onions around the base of the tray. Season both sides of your fish with sea salt and black pepper and lay it on top of the onions. Try to sweep most of the onions under the fish so they sweeten as they cook.",
      "Add a pinch of salt and pepper, the grated garlic and a pinch of cayenne to the olive oil, then grate over the zest of half your lemon. Toss the peeled prawns through this mixture until nicely coated, then stuff them loosely inside the fish, pouring over any flavoured oil left behind in the bowl. Before putting it into the oven drizzle over some olive oil and a splash of white wine, then halve your lemon and add both halves to the tray. Adjust the cooking time depending on the size of your fish: a large fish will want 25 minutes, 2 small fish about 12 minutes. You’ll know it’s beautifully cooked when the flesh flakes away from the bone.",
      "Finely chop your parsley leaves and sprinkle them over the fish once it’s out of the oven. Squeeze over the juices from your roasted lemon halves, and serve. I like to put this in the middle of the table with something propping up one end of the tray so that the delicious milky juices run out of the fish and mingle with the olive oil and lemon juices at one end of the tray. Spoon this over clumps of your fish and prawns, and anything else you’re serving it with, like new potatoes, mash or simple steamed greens – it will taste wonderful."

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Toss the sweet potato wedges in a roasting tray with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the paprika and a lug of olive oil. Cook in the hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.",

      "Put a large frying pan on a medium heat. Add a good lug of olive oil along with the garlic and rosemary to flavour the oil. When the garlic starts to sizzle, it’s time to add the fish. Shake the fillets so any excess breadcrumbs fall off then add to the pan, skin-side down. If you’re cooking fish fingers, they’ll need 5 to 6 minutes; a whole fillet will take 7 to 8 minutes. Don’t be tempted to touch the fish, use your instincts and let it cook until golden on the underside before flipping it over and reducing to a low heat while it finishes cooking.",
      "Meanwhile, chop off the tough ends of the basil stalks then pound the rest of it with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar until you’ve got a paste. Add the mayonnaise, yoghurt and lemon juice and muddle it all together.",
      "Serve the pouting with a portion of sweet potato chips, a good dollop of basil mayo and a wedge of lemon for squeezing over. Delicious with a crisp green salad or hot buttered peas."

Take half this mixture and rub it over the inside of the lamb. Season it well with salt and pepper, then roll up the lamb and secure it with 4 or 5 pieces of string.

Sometimes the lamb may need a little longer, depending on the age of the animal. You'll also want enough juice left in the bottom of the tray to give everyone a nice spoonful – if it looks as if the liquid is going to cook away too quickly, add a little water and place a cartouche on top. Skim off any fat that cooks out of the meat.",

      "Get a high-sided pan or wok on a medium-high heat to get nice and hot, and pour your stock into a small pan on a low heat to get warm. To make your fragrant soup base, add the lime leaves, chillies, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and a pinch of salt to a food processor. Chop the top few leaves off your bunch of coriander and pop to one side, then add the rest to the processor and blitz for 30 seconds or so until fairly fine. With the processor still running, add a few good lugs of olive oil, the five-spice and ground cumin. Tip this mixture straight into your hot pan, you can add a splash of stock to loosen it if you want, and fry and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts smelling fantastic. Add your sliced onion, then cook gently for 8 to 10 minutes.",
      "Add the squash to the pan and stir well, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the squash is lovely and soft. At this point, add the rice and give it a really good stir. If it looks a bit dry, you can add a splash of water here. Continue to simmer for about 8 minutes until the rice is almost cooked, then add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes until hot through and thickened a little. I like to squash up some of the squash at this point too.",
      "Take the pan off the heat, give it a good stir, then taste and season carefully with salt and pepper. To give it a bit of twang add the lime juice – the amount you need will depend on how juicy your limes are, so keep tasting it as you go. Scatter with more sliced fresh chilli and your reserved coriander leaves before serving.",
      "If you’re making this for a party, what I like to do is to hack the top off a massive pumpkin, scoop out the insides, then bake the shell in the oven for 40 minutes at 100ºC/220ºF/gas ¼. You can then use this as a receptacle for your hot soup, and as long as it’s an inch or so thick, it should keep warm for a good hour or so. Have it sitting out at the party with a load of little cups and bowls lined up next to it and a bunch of lime wedges, and let everyone help themselves!"

Loosen with 2 good lugs of olive oil. Pat the venison dry with some kitchen paper, and rub the oil mixture all over it. Sear the meat in a hot pan on all sides – roughly 6 minutes for medium rare, 7-8 minutes for medium, and you’d have to be a nutter if you wanted to cook it for any longer than that! Depending on the thickness of the meat and the heat of the pan, it may need a little less or more time to cook – so don’t look at the clock, look at the meat. This is the time when you want to try to be instinctive with your meat. Remove it from the pan when it’s cooked to your liking and allow it to rest on a plate for 4 minutes, covered with tinfoil.",

Turn up the heat again, add the wine, and let it reduce by half. Add the blueberries and simmer slowly for 4 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat, add the butter, and jiggle and shake the pan around so the sauce goes slightly opaque and shiny. Season to taste.",

      "First of all, lay your fish out in one layer on your worktop to give you an idea of how much you are dealing with. Next get yourself a pan with a lid – ideally one that’s the right size for the fish to be spread out in one layer. This is so that it can all cook at the same time. Put your pan on the heat, add 4 or 5 tablespoons of olive oil, and slowly fry your onions, fennel, chilli, fennel seeds and bay leaf with the lid on until nice and softened. This should take about 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile put your couscous in a bowl and just cover it with salted, boiling water. Put to one side to soak for about 5 minutes. When the onions are sweet and soft, add the tomatoes and anchovies, stir together and carefully season to taste. Shake the pan so that the onions and tomatoes cover the bottom of the pan evenly. Dress the couscous lightly with a little olive oil and the juice and zest of one of the lemons. Sprinkle the couscous over the top of the onions and tomatoes in one even layer. Then place the fish over the top of that and finish off with a drizzle of olive oil. Place the lid on top and simmer slowly on the hob for about 12 minutes.",

Serve the pan of fish in the middle of the table with a bowl of yoghurt and let everyone help themselves. Lightly stir the fish up, check the seasoning and eat straight away."

Bring everything to the boil, then turn down to a medium to low heat and stir constantly for about 15 minutes. This combination of flavours will be absolutely beautiful, but you’ve got to help the dish along by doing your job and making sure each grain of rice gets the same amount of love. So every now and then, stir from the outside of the pan into the middle so you get a sort of pile of rice in the centre, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Flatten the pile out with your spoon, then start the whole process again.",
      "After 15 minutes the rice should be cooked, but still have a bit of a bite, so add the mussels or clams and the prawns. You may want to add an extra splash of stock here if the rice looks a bit dry. Keep stirring, and as the clams and mussels start to open and the prawns begin to turn pink, add your squid and green beans and cook for a further 5 minutes or so. Discard any clams or mussels that don't open. Stir in the chopped parsley leaves and the juice from half your lemon wedges, and bring to the table with the remaining lemon wedges on the side and a crisp green salad."

      "This is a great dish I made near my family’s historical stomping ground on the Essex coast: Leigh-on-Sea. I used Dover sole, but any sustainable or MSC-approved flatfish like plaice, dab or lemon sole would also be fantastic. Dover sole can be a bit on the pricey side, but they are so tasty that they are a wonderful treat every now and then. You want them skinned, with the heads left on, so ask your fishmonger to do this for you. I've used fresh cockles and peeled brown shrimps, which are deliciously sweet, but way underrated. This dish is best made for two so you can cook everything together quickly in one large pan. There's something about the way these ingredients work together that makes it such a luxurious dinner. Hope you love it..",
      "Sort through the cockles or clams and tap them. If any stay open, throw them away. Give them a wash and slush about in a bowl of cold water. Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and slice the bacon into matchsticks, then add to the pan along with a drizzle of olive oil and fry until lightly golden. Strip the leaves from the sprigs of rosemary and add to the pan. Fry for a few more minutes, then remove everything to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add a small knob of butter to the bacon fat, give it a little shake and carefully lay both fish in the hot pan, head to tail. You're going to cook them at a medium high heat, so it won't take long, but the cooking shouldn't run away from you. Cook the fish for about 4 minutes, then carefully and confidently turn each one over with a large fish slice. Quickly return the rosemary and bacon to the pan and add the shrimps and the cockles or clams. Using a tea towel to protect your hands, cover the pan immediately with a lid or tinfoil, making it as airtight as you can. Cook for another 4 minutes, or until the cockles have all opened.",
      "Finely slice the chives, then remove the foil when the time is up. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon, scatter over the chives, add a good pinch of salt and pepper, then chivvy the pan around with a sense of urgency and remove the fish to a warm platter or two plates, pouring over all the juices and seafood from the pan. Nice served with wedges of lemon on the side and a simple pea and spinach salad, some buttered asparagus or new potatoes."

      "Roasting a joint of lamb is still one of the most nostalgic times for me. A thousand pictures go through my head just thinking about my old man slicing lamb on a Sunday. This brilliant roast lamb dish uses Italian staples to make a delicious stuffing – it’s nice to get all the herbs in the ingredients list, but if you can only get hold of a couple, don’t worry.",
      "Try to buy the lamb from your own butcher or a supermarket with a qualified butcher’s section. Tell them you want a nice leg of lamb, preferably organic, with the H-bone and thigh-bone tunnel-boned and removed. This sounds complicated but it’s just butchers’ jargon. It means the top half of the leg has the bone removed leaving just the ankle bone, allowing you to stuff it. For the veg, turnips, Jerusalem artichokes, celeriac, fennel and parsnips are all good.",
      "Peel a couple of garlic cloves and pop them into a food processor – as it’s whizzing add your mixed herbs. Add the pancetta and anchovies and whiz again. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and add the bread to the processor. Whiz to coarse breadcrumbs, and add to the bowl with the pine nuts and olives. Add salt and pepper and scrunch everything together with your hands. If it looks too dry, add a drop of boiling water. Push the stuffing into the cavity in the lamb. You can roast it stuffed like this, or you can tie it up with string, pushing some rosemary underneath. Pat it with olive oil on the outside and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Toss the potatoes and remaining garlic with the bay leaves, the rest of the rosemary and some olive oil, salt and pepper and put them into a roasting tray with the lamb in the middle. It’s unusual to see rare or pink roasted meats in Italy, so we’re going to cook our lamb like they do. Roast it for about an hour and a half at 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Trust me – it will be juicy and delicious! After half an hour, the Italian way is to start basting the lamb with a swig of wine over the meat and veg every 15 minutes or so until the meat is cooked. Remove the veg to a dish when cooked to keep them warm.",
      "When the lamb is cooked, let it rest for 15 minutes. It’s nice served with some simply cooked greens. The Italians prefer the goodness from the meat juices to be cooked into the vegetables in the tray rather than make gravy."

Carefully place on top of the pie, then trim off any overhanging pastry. Pinch and squash the edges of the pastry to the dish.",
      "Eggwash the top, and cook the pie right at the bottom of the hot oven for around 45 to 50 minutes, or until your pastry is golden and gorgeous. Serve with steamed drained greens."

      "Just about everyone gets excited when they see roast pork on the table. But even though a whole roasted shoulder is really impressive, it’s actually a ‘slam and go’ recipe. Of course it’s lovely served with roast potatoes and orchard apple sauce, but lately, I’ve been pulling all the meat apart and tossing it through this great jerk salsa – hell, yeah! The flavours of Jamaica and Britain really work well together – and actually many of the same spices found in jerk can also be found in some of the most quintessentially British puddings, syrups and even our beloved mulled wine. This is my version of jerk-dressed pork, and I love it.",
      "Preheat the oven to full whack (about 240°C/475°F/gas 9). Carefully score the skin and fat on the shoulder into zigzags about 1cm deep, using a very sharp knife or a clean Stanley knife. Sprinkle and rub in a good pinch of salt, pepper, dried rosemary, thyme, and a few good gratings of nutmeg. Add a lug of olive oil, then rub those flavours all over the meat and into the scores. Place the pork, skin side up, in your largest roasting pan. Pour one of the bottles of cider into the bottom of the tray, put into the hot oven for 30 minutes so the crackling gets going, then turn the heat down to 130°C/250°F/gas ½.",
      "After the pork has been in for an hour, add the rest of the cider and cook for a further 6 to 7 hours, or until the meat pulls apart easily. Halfway through the cooking time cover with a double layer of tin foil.",
      "Once the pork is perfectly cooked, move it to a large serving board or platter. Carefully pour any fat from the roasting tray into a Kilner jar for some lucky roast potato some day, but leave the wonderful flavourful cooking juices in the pan. Then add the Scotch bonnets to a liquidizer with the spring onions, spices, the juice from the limes, ginger, bay leaves, garlic, a squeeze of honey and 2 lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Pulse together until you get a salsa consistency, then mix the salsa into the juices in the roasting tray, have a taste and balance out the salt and acid if needed. It should have attitude and loads of personality. Pour that salsa on to a platter, then pull the crispy crackling off the shoulder, get rid of any flobbery fat underneath, and use two forks to roughly pull the meat apart. Pile the meat on top of the salsa and toss together quickly.",
      "Tear over any coriander leaves and snap those wonderful zigzags of crackling on top of the meat and serve with good quality apple sauce. Rock ’n’ roll!"

Open out the bird on to a board, then press down on the breasts until you hear the breastbone crack.",
      "With a sharp knife, slash the meat all over the thighs and legs to help them cook quicker and take on more flavour.",

Add a small lug of olive oil to get the flavour going and add 1 pinch of sea salt for each bird. Mix well. Rub this marinade onto your poussins. Pop them in sandwich bags and put them in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour. You can leave them in there overnight if you want to.",
      "Remove your birds from the fridge 1 hour before cooking, but keep them out of the sun. When ready to cook, drop the poussins onto the hottest part of your barbie. Give them a couple of minutes on each side and make sure you move them any time that flames come up - you want them to be golden, not black! Once you’ve got a nice colour, move them to the cooler part of your barbie to finish cooking – they’ll need about 20 minutes. You can tell they’re cooked through when you can easily pull the thigh meat away from the bone.",
      "Stir the juice and zest of your remaining lime and the finely chopped mint through the yoghurt. Serve the poussins with a good dollop of minty yoghurt, sprinkled with the chilli and baby mint leaves. Delicious."

      "Chicken cacciatora seems to be reasonably well known in Britain because it’s the classic pre-packed dish you find in Italian food ranges in supermarkets (which, to be honest, never taste of much). When you get the real deal cooked at home with love and passion it’s a totally different experience. It’s a simple combination of flavours that just works really well. Cacciatore means ‘hunter’, so this is obviously the type of food that a hunter’s wife cooks for her fella when he gets home from a hard morning spent in the countryside. This is also a great dish for big parties, as it looks after itself in the oven. In the picture I’ve made it for about 12 people.",
      "Season the chicken pieces with salt and freshly ground black pepper and put them into a bowl. Add the bay leaves and rosemary sprigs and the crushed clove of garlic and cover with the wine. Leave to marinate for at least an hour, but preferably overnight in the fridge.",
      "Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Drain the chicken, reserving the marinade, and pat dry with kitchen paper. Dust the chicken pieces with flour and shake off any excess. Heat an ovenproof pan, add a splash of olive oil, fry the chicken pieces until browned lightly all over and put to one side.",
      "Place the pan back on the heat and add the sliced garlic. Fry gently until golden brown, then add the anchovies, olives, tomatoes (broken up with a wooden spoon) and the chicken pieces with their reserved marinade. Bring to the boil, cover with a lid or a double thickness layer of foil and bake in the preheated oven for 1½ hours.",
      "Skim off any oil that’s collected on top of the sauce, then stir, taste and add a little salt and pepper if necessary. Remove the bay leaves and rosemary sprigs, and serve with a salad, or some cannellini beans, and plenty of Chianti."

      "I tasted my first mussel at the age of eight. I remember looking at the pile of shells and thinking, I’m never going to eat those, but my mum said, ‘Don’t look at them, darling, just eat them,’ so I did. Once I figured out how to use an empty shell as pincers to grab the meat from the other shells, I went through the whole bowl in no time flat. Mussels are one of the most sustainable types of seafood. They can be cultivated on a large or small scale, they clean the water around them, take literally 4 minutes to cook and are nutritious and wonderful to eat … I can’t think of any negatives! What are you waiting for?",
      "Quickly wash and debeard all the mussels (pull off any bits that look like wire wool), discarding any that won’t close (your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask in advance). Trim, wash, then finely slice the leek and the stick of celery, reserving any of the delicate yellow leaves for sprinkling over later. Put a really wide, deep pot on a medium heat and add a lug of olive oil and a knob of butter, along with the sliced leek and celery. Cook and stir for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened, then flake in the smoked haddock and pour in the whisky – feel free to light it with a match to burn off the alcohol if you want. I think this adds to the flavour, but don’t set yourself on fire.",
      "Next, add the mussels and single cream. Stir and shake the pan, put the lid on and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or literally just until the mussels have all popped open – discard any that haven’t. Use a slotted spoon to move them to a large serving platter or bowl. Leave the pan of cooking liquor on the heat and let it bubble away until it thickens to a consistency you’re happy with. While that’s happening, roughly chop the parsley, then add it to the pot and shake it about. Have a quick taste of the sauce, correct the seasoning if it needs it, and pour all over the mussels. Scatter over any celery leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve straight away with fresh or toasted hunks of bread for a beautiful hearty lunch or dinner."

      "A mushroom risotto can be taken in many different ways, depending on what kind of mushrooms you have and whether they are introduced at the very beginning of cooking or just added at the end, as I’m going to do here. The inspiration for this recipe came when I was in Japan and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan. This way of cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last minute before serving.",
      "Heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover. Leave for a couple of minutes until they’ve softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid.",
      "In a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it a stir. Stir in the vermouth or wine – it’ll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan and add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn the heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next.",
      "Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until soft. If your pan isn’t big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands, get stuck in and toss everything together – this is going to be incredible!",
      "Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and the Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you think it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes.",
      "Take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like. Serve a good dollop of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Great for a starter or a snack, and I've even made little mini ones as canapés (dare I say that word?!).",
      "Remove the crusts from the ciabatta and tear up into rough 2.5cm/1 inch pieces. Throw into a bowl with the bacon and lemon zest. Divide each mozzarella into 8 similar-sized pieces and add to the bowl. Keeping the leaf tips on the rosemary sticks, remove the lower leaves and then smash these up in a pestle and mortar with the garlic. Stir in 8 tablespoons of olive oil, then pour this mixture over the bread, cheese and bacon. Marinate for anything from 15 minutes to an hour.",
      "Thread your mozzarella and bread on to your rosemary sticks, weaving the bacon in and around. Line up the kebabs on a wire rack and place under the grill on a very high heat until the bread and bacon are golden and crisp and the mozzarella is nice and gooey. While this is grilling make sure you keep an eye on it, as it can turn into a charred kebab very quickly. To make the dressing, chop up the olives and mix with the chilli, 5 tablespoons of the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Season to taste.",
      "To serve the kebabs, dress the herbs with half of the olive dressing right at the last minute so the leaves stay nice and fresh, then use the other half of the dressing drizzled over the kebabs.",

      "When I was in Altamura, in Puglia, I cooked this grilled and roasted pork loin with a group of Italian friends. It’s a great thing to serve at a party because when you’ve grilled it on all sides for 15 minutes you can just pop it into a hot oven for an hour quite happily and leave it – and you can serve it as a hot roast or have it cold. My boss at the River Café, Rose Gray, used to baste her grilled pork with herb vinegar and bay leaves, which was a tremendous combination, so feel free to do this, or to use rosemary instead of bay. The way we flavoured ours in Italy was with fennel seeds, dried chilli, salt and pepper. I’m going to give you the recipe for 12, but feel free to halve it, or even double it. It’s dead simple, and it’s made even easier if you ask your butcher to prepare the meat for you. Just ask for a 2kg/4½lb loin of pork, off the bone with the skin removed.",
      "First of all, smash your fennel seeds up in a pestle and mortar and crumble and bash in your dried chilli – now this is supposed to give a subtle heat, so I’m going to leave it up to you to use as much or as little as you prefer. Put your loin of pork on to a chopping board and score the fat in a criss-cross fashion. Rub the meat all over with a little olive oil, then sprinkle the fennel seeds and chilli all over the pork. Cover the pork up and put it to one side in a roasting tray – if it has come straight out of the fridge let it come to room temperature – so that it can absorb the flavours.",
      "About an hour before you’re ready to cook, you need to light your barbecue to let it get to the right temperature. I’d advise you to use charcoal instead of gas so that you get a lovely chargrilled flavour coming through. You can also, of course, roast the meat in the oven, but I prefer to do it on the barbecue. (If you roast it in the oven for the whole time it’ll need 1 hour 20 minutes.) Either way, season the meat quite generously with salt and pepper and place it fat-side down on the grill. This will make the barbecue flame a bit so you’ll probably need to turn it over quickly on to the meat side, but it does tend to get the bars oiled up and the smoke going, which we like. Grill the meat for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how hot your barbecue is, and remember to keep turning it so it gets those lovely charred bar marks all over it.",
      "Remove the pork to the same roasting tray you marinated it in and put it into the oven at 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. After half an hour add the vinegar and rosemary leaves, carefully move the meat around and baste it, and put it back into the oven for another 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, leave it to rest for 10 minutes, then slice the meat up. All the lovely juices from the tray can be kept warm and poured over the meat just before serving. If you’ve been to Italy, you may have noticed that you really do just get some slices of meat with a simple side dish. At the end of the day, the meat tastes great; so serve it in any way you see fit."

      "I’ve written this recipe to be cooked on the barbecue, because the flavour will be amazing, but it also works really well when roasted in the oven at 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. If you cook it in the oven, turn the pieces of rabbit several times to ensure even colour and cooking. If you cook it on the barbecue, you’ll need 5 wooden or metal skewers (soak wooden ones before you use them). Whether barbecuing or roasting, here are your rough timings:",
      "Belly: 25 to 30 minutes.\nKidneys and liver: 4 minutes.\nSaddle and ribs: 15 to 20 minutes.\nLegs and shoulder: 35 to 40 minutes.",
      "Put your rabbit pieces into a bowl. Using a pestle and mortar, or a liquidizer, bash or whiz up the thyme and rosemary leaves to a pulp, then add the garlic cloves and bash or whiz again. Stir in 8 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon zest and juice and the honey, and pour this over the rabbit. Put the meat to one side and let it come to room temperature while you light your barbecue.",
      "Now I’m going to talk about flavour. Get a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme and tie them together like a little brush. Each time you turn the meat, dab it with a little of the marinade to give you a lovely encrusted layer of flavour. This rabbit is going to be really tasty!",
      "Keeping the marinade to one side, remove the pieces of meat and season with salt and pepper. Sandwich the pancetta between the 2 pieces of belly using 3 skewers. Put the legs and shoulder on the barbecue. When they’ve been cooking for 10 minutes, put the belly on. After another 10 minutes put the saddle and ribs on. Make sure you turn the meat over every so often. Look after it by controlling the temperature and basting it continuously with the marinade. Cut three-quarters of the way through each kidney and open them out like a book. Cut the liver into 4 pieces and push one piece on to each remaining skewer, followed by a kidney and more liver.",
      "When all the pieces of meat are beautifully cooked, add your skewered bits of kidney and liver on to the barbecue and cook until golden, along with your 2 remaining slices of pancetta. After a few minutes, when the pancetta is browned, put it on top of the meat at the cooler end of the barbie. Now get your guests round the table.",
      "You can serve the rabbit with any white beans, or roast potatoes, or grilled vegetables, or different salads – it really depends on how you feel and what the weather’s like. Just put a big bowl of your chosen accompaniment in the middle of the table and serve all the meat on a board. Lovely with a glass of white wine. Simple, honest and bloody good."

Roll the meat up quite tightly then tie it up as tightly as you can with 4 or 5 pieces of string. Drizzle all over with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and rub the seasoning all over the skin to help it turn into delicious crackling. Lay your carrots across the middle of the roasting tray and put the meat on top. Pour your glass of red or mulled wine and a glass of water in the bottom of the tray then put your meat in the oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for about 3 ½ to 4 hours until lovely and golden. Once it’s out of the oven carefully remove the skin and put it to one side.

      "When I took my students to Italy to see how olive oil was made, we ate these ‘fried’ pizzas at a great little restaurant called Il Vescovino in Panzano in the Chianti region. The chef fried the thin bases in oil, like poppadoms, then quickly topped them with tomato sauce, mozzarella and a little bit of oregano and popped them straight under a hot grill. They were the lightest pizzas I've ever eaten – just incredible – and this is how the first ever pizzas were made. First, make your basic pizza dough. Now make your tomato sauce. Heat a saucepan, add a splash of oil and the sliced garlic and cook gently. When the garlic has turned light golden, add half the basil, the tomatoes and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook gently for about 20 minutes, mashing the tomatoes until smooth, then taste, season again and put to one side.",
      "Preheat your grill to its highest temperature. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and press them flat on to a floured work surface. Roll them out to about 0.5cm/¼ inch thick and allow them to rest for 10 minutes or so. Heat a frying pan over a high heat, add about 2cm of vegetable oil and fry each pizza for 30 seconds or so on each side. Remove with tongs and place on a baking tray.",
      "Once all the bases are fried, smear each one with a spoonful of the tomato sauce and tear over some mozzarella and a leaf or two of basil or dried oregano. Drizzle with olive oil and grill until the cheese is bubbling and the dough is light brown and cooked through."

So go for something with good marbling and a bit of integrity. It can be served on a sharing platter with different salads sprinkled on top. The truffle oil’s optional, but the flavour is interesting, so give it a try because it’s something new. This whole dish is impressive and damn tasty.",
      "OK, first things first – whack your oven on to its highest heat. For this dish we’re going to cook the meat on the platter it will be served on, so ideally use one of those classic cheap old metal flats or trays. Or you can use regular serving plates instead, if you know they’re heatproof. Rub them with extra virgin olive oil or truffle oil. And now you’re going to prepare the meat. Work with one piece at a time, and put it on a 30cm piece of bin-liner with another piece on top. Using a rolling pin, evenly slap the meat until it’s 4 times the width you started with, but a quarter of the thickness.",
      "Lay the meat on your tray, platter or plate right to the edges – you can let it hang over a tiny bit. Put your rosemary leaves into a sieve and run hot water over them to get the oils and flavours going. Put them into a little bowl, pour 3 or 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil on top and massage the leaves with your fingers to get more flavour out of them. Stir the garlic into the rosemary oil, then pat everything evenly all over the meat. The meat can be prepared to this point a few hours in advance, then cling-filmed and kept in the fridge.",
      "Now all you’ve got to do is get a little salad together. Tear your rocket and radicchio into a large bowl. Slice your mushrooms as thinly as possible and add them to the bowl.",
      "This dish is best put together really quickly at the last minute. All you need to do is put the meat in the preheated oven for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your oven). By the time you’ve dressed the salad, with a little extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, and put your block of Parmesan on the table with a speed peeler for shaving pieces off it, you can take the meat out of the oven – it should be paler in colour now. The idea is not to cook the meat, it’s simply to warm it through. Scatter the salad over and serve it straight away. Shave over some Parmesan and have a nice glass of wine with it. Tasty, tasty and very gorgeous!"

Other things to have on the table are some crunchy sweet pickled gherkins, some pickled onions (if your other half isn't around!) – and pickled chillies are good, too.

Get a roasting tray slightly bigger than the chicken, then add all of the marinade ingredients and 2 level teaspoons of sea salt and mix together well. Put on a pair of clean rubber gloves, then really massage those flavours over and inside the chicken so it’s smeared everywhere. Don’t be shy! Ideally marinate overnight in the fridge.",
      "Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and organize your shelves so the roasting tray can sit right at the bottom, the chicken can sit directly above it, right on the bars of the shelf, and the potatoes can go at the top. Halve any larger potatoes, then parboil them in a large pan of salted boiling water with a whole lemon for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through. Drain the potatoes then let them steam dry. Stab the lemon a few times with a sharp knife and put it right into the chicken’s cavity. Move the chicken to a plate.",
      "Roughly chop the onions and add to the roasting tray along with the cinnamon stick, cloves, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, then whisk in the flour. Pour in the stock or water, then place this right at the bottom of the oven. Place the chicken straight on to the bars of the middle shelf, above the roasting tray. Cook for 1 hour 20 minutes.",
      "Put another sturdy roasting tray over a medium heat and add the olive oil, the mustard and cumin seeds, garam masala and turmeric – work quickly because if the fat gets too hot the mustard seeds will pop everywhere. Halve a bulb of garlic and add it straight to the pan, with the sliced chilli and chopped tomatoes. Add your drained potatoes to the tray, mix everything together, then season well. Finely slice and scatter in the coriander stalks, and keep the leaves in a bowl of water for later. After the chicken has been in for 40 minutes, put the potatoes in.",
      "Once the chicken is cooked, move it to a board and carefully peel off the dark charred bits to reveal perfect chicken underneath. Pass the gravy through a coarse sieve into a pan, whisking any sticky goodness from the pan as you go. Bring to the boil and either cook and thicken or thin down with water to your preference. Put it into a serving bowl and drizzle over a little yoghurt. Get your potatoes out of the oven and put them into a serving bowl, then serve the chicken on a board next to the sizzling roasties and hot gravy. Sprinkle the reserved coriander leaves over everything and serve with any condiments you like. Life doesn’t get much better."

      "Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Season your beautiful fish fillets with the rosemary, finely grated lemon zest (no bitter white pith, please) and pepper – you don’t need to use salt because we’re going to wrap the fish in the lovely salty smoked bacon. Lay your rashers of bacon or pancetta on a board and one by one run the flat of a knife along them to thin them and widen them out. Lay 3 rashers together, slightly overlapping, put a fish fillet on top and wrap the rashers around it.",
      "Lightly heat a large ovenproof frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and lay your fish, prettiest side facing up, in the pan. Fry for a minute, then place the pan in your preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish, until the bacon is crisp and golden.",
      "While the fish is cooking, you can make your simple lemon mayonnaise. I do this by mixing quality low-fat mayonnaise with the juice of half a lemon and pepper. You want to add enough lemon juice to make the flavour slightly too zingy. This is because, when you eat it with the asparagus and the fish, it will lessen slightly in intensity. And don’t worry if the mayo looks a little thinner than usual when you’ve added the lemon juice – think of it as more delicate.",
      "The asparagus is a great accompaniment because, like the fish, it also loves bacon. You can either boil or steam it; either way it’s light and a nice contrast to the meatiness of the fish. When cooked, toss it in the juices that come out of the fish. Simply serve the fish next to a nice pile of asparagus, drizzled with the lemon-spiked mayonnaise. And if you’re feeling very hungry, serve with some steaming-hot new potatoes."

      "Peking duck is something that has always been very close to the Oliver family. Bizarrely enough, the fact that my parents ran a pub restaurant meant that we very rarely went out for dinner as a family, but when we did, my old man used to take us out to this Chinese restaurant in Sawbridgeworth where we all fell in love with Peking duck.",
      "There are hundreds of ways of cooking duck in Asian cultures – steamed, roasted, pumped up with bicycle pumps to remove the meat from the skin – but we're at home and so we can't do with all this mucking about. My way is simple and it works...",
      "Preheat the oven to 170ºC/325ºF/gas 3. Rub a nice 1.2kg duck with loads of salt, inside and out. Dust the bird all over with five-spice and, if you've got any, grate some fresh ginger and rub it round the cavity, leaving the ginger inside to flavour. Place the duck in a roasting tray and put it in the oven. All you need to do is check on it every so often and spoon away the excess fat that has rendered out of the duck. This will make the skin go wonderfully crispy. Generally, after a couple of hours it will be perfect – the leg meat will pull off the bone and the skin will be wonderfully crisp. You don't always need to, but I sometimes turn the heat up to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6 for a short while until it's really crispy.",
      "While this beautiful bird is cooking, you can make your plum sauce. Chuck 10 or 12 destoned plums into a pan with 5 tablespoons of sugar, a couple of pinches of five-spice, a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce, half a teaspoon of chilli powder and a splash of water. Bring to the boil, then simmer until you get a nice shiny pulp. You can remove the plum skins if you want to, but I usually leave them in. Sometimes I add a little grated orange zest, as this goes well with duck. Put the sauce to one side to cool before serving it, and taste to check the seasoning.",
      "As for the spring onions and cucumber, that's straightforward. Use half a cucumber and a bunch of spring onions and finely slice them. I strongly advise buying a couple of packs of pre-made pancakes which you can place in a steamer or microwave and slowly steam until nice and hot. The bamboo steamers are only a few quid from Chinese supermarkets, so it's worth getting hold of some and they're great to serve at the table.",
      "Once the duck has cooled a little bit, use two forks to shred all the meat off the carcass. I remember the Chinese lady at the restaurant in Sawbridgeworth doing this. You can do the same, putting all the meat with its crispy skin on to a serving plate. Take a pancake, place some duck, a bit of spring onion, a little cucumber and a dollop of plum sauce on to it, then roll it up – lovely."

Pat the salmon steaks with a little olive oil, season and place skin-side down in the frying pan. Leave them for 2 minutes to get really crispy then check how they're doing. They'll want around 4 minutes on the skin side and 1 minute on the other. You'll get an idea of how they're cooking as you'll see the salmon change colour.",
      "When the fennel has had 4 minutes, add the green beans and the broad beans. Give them a further 2 minutes. By this time you will probably want to turn over the salmon steaks for their last minute. Add the peas to the other veg and cook for a final 2 minutes. Don't be tempted to overcook the salmon – remove it from the heat. Divide the vegetables between 4 bowls, rip over the mint and basil, ladle over some of your hot cooking stock and place the salmon on top. Serve with a dollop of aïoli. Fantastic!"

      "When your barbie’s ready, lay the salmon on the bars, skin side down. The flesh will start to colour from the bottom up and after about 4 minutes the skin should be beautifully golden brown.",
      "Carefully flip the salmon over with a roasting fork or a spatula and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. While it’s cooking, gently ease the skin away from the fish and put it on the barbie alongside to crisp up. If your salmon is wild it will have slightly less fat in it, so will be a drier fish. You can therefore cook it for a shorter amount of time, even leaving it slightly undercooked – although this might feel unusual to us Brits, who nuke fish beyond belief, this is a really good idea!",
      "If it’s (organically) farmed, cook it through, but please don’t overcook it or it will become too dry. Lift the salmon carefully off the barbecue and place it on a nice serving platter or board. Allow to cool a little, then break the skin into pieces, a bit like poppadoms.",

      "Break the salmon up with a fork into four to six chunks. Serve with the cucumber yoghurt, sprinkled with the rest of the chopped chilli and the remaining fennel tops or basil. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and make sure everyone gets a piece of the crunchy fish skin."

      "Marcy Tatarka, an absolutely lovely cook I met in Wyoming, was full of all sorts of local food knowledge. She told me that people in this part of America are really into their pasties! Turns out that in the 1920s and 30s, miners from Cornwall came over to work in Montana and it wasn’t long before the locals developed a taste for the good old Cornish pasty. Their recipes haven’t evolved radically since, but they do embrace local ingredients like chicken, squash and sage. Pastry isn’t exactly health food, but a delicious pasty once in a while won’t hurt you. If you like, you can make a slightly ‘skinnier’ pasty by reducing the butter to 200g and adding 50ml of olive oil. But frankly, if I’m making these I just go for it old-school style.",
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Bring your butter and water to the boil in a large pan, then take the pan off the heat. Stir the flour and 1 tablespoon of sea salt into the mixture bit by bit with a spatula, until you’ve got a dough. Tip it on to a floured surface and use your hands to shape it into a smooth ball. Put the ball of dough into a floured bowl, dust the top with flour, then cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes while you make the filling.",
      "Meanwhile, get a large pan and fry your chopped onion in a lug of olive oil for 10 minutes or until softened. Add the diced chicken and fry for 5 minutes until brown, then add the rest of the chopped vegetables and herbs. Fry for another 5 minutes, then add 3 or 4 good gratings of nutmeg. Season well with salt and black pepper, then pour in the chicken stock and Worcestershire sauce. Stir in the flour and simmer on a medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until most of the stock has cooked away and you’re left with nice thick gravy.",
      "Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then divide your pastry dough in half and roll each half out until it’s slightly thinner than 0.5cm. Use a cereal bowl (about 15cm in diameter) to cut 4 circles out of each half, so you end up with 8 circles. You may need to cut out 2 or 3 circles from each half first, then re-roll the remaining pastry to make the rest. Dust the circles with flour, and spoon your filling into the middle of each one. Brush the edges of the pastry with some of the beaten egg, then fold each circle in half over the filling and crimp the edges with your finger and thumb to seal them. If you want to see how this is done, check out this video on how to assemble a pasty.",
      "Line 2 baking trays with greaseproof paper, scatter a handful of cornmeal or polenta over the paper, and place your pasties on top. Brush the pasties all over with more of the beaten egg and sprinkle over a little more cornmeal. Bake in the hot oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden, and serve straight away with a fresh green salad. A taste of Cornwall in the Wild West – who’d have thought it!"

Good salt cod is quite hard to find these days, so I've adapted the recipe to use fresh cod, but you can also use hake, bass or halibut.",

      "olive oil",
      "300 g quality smoked sausage, such as andouille or fresh iberico chorizo , skin removed, cut into 1cm thick slices",

    "instructions": [
      "Jambalaya is a French word that means ‘jumbled’ or ‘mixed up’, and I have no doubt that the philosophy and heart of this recipe come from a similar place to paella, kedgeree and risotto.",
      "Originally, any Louisiana ‘critter’ unlucky enough to get caught would have gone into this: rabbit, duck, squirrel, frog, alligator. . . you name it! And similarly, you can adapt it to whatever your local butcher or fishmonger happens to have. Go cheaper by using things like frozen prawns and chicken livers, or more expensive by including lobster or crab. I used an incredible local smoked sausage called andouille, but fresh chorizo or any other smoked sausage would work just as well.",
      "This dish makes me happy every time I eat it. And if more people than expected turn up for dinner just add a bit of extra rice.",
      "Season the chicken with sea salt, black pepper and a pinch of cayenne. Pour a couple of lugs of oil into a large casserole type pan and brown the chicken pieces and sliced sausage over a medium heat. After 5 minutes, once nicely browned on all sides, add your onion, peppers and celery as well as your bay, thyme and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir, then fry on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes stirring every now and again. It’s important to control the heat of the pan: you don’t want it to be so slow nothing’s happening, or so fast that things are catching and burning. You want a steady, solid heat.",
      "Once the veg have softened, add your garlic and chillies, stir around for a minute, then stir in the tinned tomatoes and chicken stock.",
      "Bring everything to the boil, then turn the heat down, pop the lid on the pan and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. When you can pull the meat off the bone and shred it easily the chicken’s ready. Feel free to remove the chicken bones at this point if you like, then add your rice. Give it all a good stir, then put the lid on. Give it a stir every few minutes, scraping the goodness off the bottom of the pan as you go. Let it cook for about 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked. Stir in the prawns and if it needs it, add enough water to make it a kind of porridgey consistency (look at the picture). Pop the lid back on and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes while you chop your parsley. Stir the parsley through and serve on a lovely big platter. I absolutely love this with a lemony green salad."

      "This is a really beautiful summer dish that takes hardly any time at all to prepare – and, of course, you can use different kinds of beans, such as black-eyed beans, flageolets, butter beans or even lentils. It's a terrific hot snack or main dish – and with the tuna all torn up it makes a great salad. I like to griddle the tuna for a minute on each side so it has colour on the outside but still remains a little pink in the middle. A lot of people still want to cook tuna all the way through (which I think is madness!), but you must do it how you like best. It's worth seeing if you prefer it pink in the middle though. I'm really going heavy on the herbs in this recipe – 4 or 5 years ago this might have been a bit OTT, but it's really easy to get hold of a good selection of herbs now, so the more the merrier.",
      "Feel free to use a couple of tins of beans if it's more convenient. Tinned beans aren't bad these days – they have got much better for some reason. But if you're using dried, which still taste better, soak them overnight in water. They'll double in size. You then just need to drain them and put them into a pan with fresh water to cover. Bring to the boil, then simmer them for around 40 minutes or until tender – sometimes I put a squashed tomato and a potato in the water with them, as it helps to soften the skins. When done, drain them, discarding the tomato and potato, and put them into a large bowl with 8 tablespoons of peppery olive oil, the red onion, anchovies and chillies. Season with salt and pepper and the lemon juice – for a bit of a twang.",
      "Preheat your griddle pan until really hot. Season the tuna steaks with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the lemon zest and pat a little olive oil on both sides. Sear the steaks for a minute on each side. While the fish is searing, get your guests round the table. Throw the herbs into the dressed beans, mix up and divide between the plates. Take the tuna off the heat, tear it up and place on top of the warm beans. Nice with some cold white wine."

      "This is a really good way to turn a cheap cut of meat into something special. In this recipe, we're going to get nice thin escalopes of pork from the leg, flavour them and prepare them so they cook quickly. You could also use chicken or even veal in the same way, if you fancy. Rub the goat's cheese with a little olive oil and cook on a hot griddle on both sides until nicely coloured. Remove and put to one side. Bash up the garlic and lemon thyme in a pestle and mortar (or use a metal bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Add a couple of splashes of olive oil, stir, and rub the mixture all over the pork escalopes.",
      "Season the pork then put the escalopes, one by one, between 2 large pieces of cling film and hit them with something heavy and flat until they're about 0.5cm thick. This will make them really tender. Do this to all 4 escalopes.",
      "Check that your griddle pan is hot, and chargrill your asparagus, then your courgettes, on both sides. Mark them nicely to give a bit of flavour and character to them. Put them into a salad bowl with the vinegar, 8 tablespoons of olive oil and half the fresh mint. Using the griddle pan again, chargrill your pork escalopes on both sides until nicely marked – about 4 minutes.",
      "Tear each escalope in half and scatter these into the salad bowl with the rest of the mint (for a lovely fresh burst of flavour) and the crumbled goat's cheese. Toss well, then place the bowl in the middle of the table and let everyone tuck in."

      "3-5 tablespoons balsamic vinegar"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "These lamb cutlets are best cooked on a hot barbecue with wood or charcoal, to give you a wonderful smoky flavour. Otherwise use a preheated ridged griddle pan. Slap the cutlets with the heel of your hand to flatten them slightly. Then bash up your thyme in a pestle and mortar and add a little olive oil. Mix together, then rub the oil over the cutlets and season both sides of them. Put to one side.",
      "Cook the mushrooms dry on the bars of your hot griddle pan. This is quite an unusual way to do it, but it gives you a nutty flavour that you wouldn’t get otherwise. Just grill them on both sides to mark them and put them into a large bowl. Once the mushrooms are done you can put the lamb on the barbecue or griddle pan. If the cutlets are about 1.5cm thick, just give them 3 or 4 minutes on each side until they’re really golden. This should cook them medium. (To be honest, I’m not really into rare lamb cutlets, but if you prefer them like that then cook for a little less time.)",
      "When cooked, put the lamb cutlets into the bowl with the mushrooms and drizzle with a little olive oil. Tear over the parsley, in quite large pieces, and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Season lightly and toss around. Place to one side to rest, to allow all the lovely juices to get sucked up by the mushrooms.",
      "Meanwhile you can make a really quick sauce. It looks a bit like pesto, but although it contains basil and pine nuts it has no similarity in flavour. In a pestle and mortar pound up the pine nuts until you have a mushy pulp – this will give the sauce a creamy flavour and texture. Remove the mixture to a bowl, then use the pestle and mortar to bash the basil up into a pulp. Add this to the pine nuts and loosen with extra virgin olive oil so that the sauce easily drops off the end of a spoon.",
      "Now you need to balance it with quite a lot of balsamic vinegar to give it a good zing, almost like a mint sauce, but add it to taste. Give the lamb and mushrooms a final toss. I like to serve this up on a big platter and let everyone help themselves. Have the sauce and a simple watercress salad on the side."

Bash to a paste and stir in your olive oil.",
      "Your fillet steaks should be about 2.5cm thick. Wrap a piece of bacon around each steak (this gives them a really good flavour) and secure loosely with a piece of string. Peel the mushroom skins off, which only takes a second and helps them absorb the marinade. Brush the steaks and mushrooms with some of your flavoured thyme oil, keeping the rest for the cooking.",
      "Try to become instinctive about cooking basic things like steaks and to understand heat, sizes and cuts of meat. Chefs test their meat by the way it looks and the resistance it gives when squeezed. Preheat your griddle pan or barbecue until really hot. I don't want to give you a specific time to cook them, as your steaks may be thicker or thinner than the ones I'm using. Whether using fillets or sirloins, I cook mine for roughly 3 or 4 minutes each side and let them rest for a couple of minutes to give me a medium-cooked steak – you can do them for a little more or less time to your preference.",
      "Season the meat on both sides and place on the griddle pan with your mushrooms. Turn every minute, and brush each time with your thyme oil brush. The mushrooms will be cooked after about 6 minutes and should be soft to the touch – cooking them this way means they don't go all soggy but they do have an intense meaty flavour. Once the beef is cooked to your liking, remove the string, divide the steaks between 4 warmed plates with your mushrooms, allow to rest for 2 minutes and put a big dollop of salsa verde over the top."

      "MARINADE",

      "1½ tablespoons white wine vinegar",
      "extra virgin olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Carpaccio is very thinly sliced raw meat. I like mine Italian-style, with the meat sliced a little more thickly. This makes it a bit more rustic and you can really taste the quality of the meat. I also like to sear the meat very quickly before slicing it up, as this gives you a contrasting encrusted edge of flavour. It’s lovely with this marinated bean salad – you can simply use green beans, or a mixture of different ones.",
      "You don’t need loads of meat for this, just a couple of slices per person, which should allow you to spend a little more on a good-quality piece of beef.",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Drop in the beans and cook for about 5 minutes. When perfectly done, drain them in a colander.",
      "To make the marinade, mix the chopped shallot or onion in a bowl with the herbs, mustard, vinegar and 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the hot cooked beans and toss. Put to one side to allow the beans to cool down and take on all the fantastic flavours.",
      "Place the beef fillet on a chopping board and season it all over with salt and pepper. Run the thyme sprigs under hot water for a few seconds – this will help to release their fragrant oils. Strip the leaves from the stalks and chop them up roughly. Sprinkle the thyme over the fillet, then roll the meat around the chopping board so that any excess seasoning and herbs stick to it.",
      "Get a heavy frying pan very hot and add a splash of oil, followed by the beef fillet. Fry for 1 minute only, turning it every few seconds to sear and encrust all the lovely flavourings on to it. Take the meat out of the frying pan and put it on to a plate to rest for a minute. (Once seared, you can serve straight away or you can keep the meat covered on a plate until needed. I prefer not to keep it in the fridge.)",
      "Slice the seared fillet with a sharp knife. Lay each slice on a board and flatten as much as you can by pressing down on them with the side of a chopping knife – it works a treat. Lay two or three slices out flat on each plate. Season again lightly and place a pile of beans on top, spooning over some of the marinade. Sprinkle over any leftover herb leaves and drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil."

      "Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge.",

This way you'll get the right cover of sauce and the right amount of crispiness on top. When I cook this at home I just use one pan to cut down on lots of washing up!",

      "Put as much spinach as will fit into the pan. Keep turning it over; it will wilt quickly so you will be able to keep adding more spinach until it's all in. Moisture will cook out of the spinach, which is fine. By cooking it this way you don't lose any of the nutrients that you would if boiling it in water.",
      "After 5 minutes, put the spinach into a large bowl and leave to cool. Place the pan back on the heat, add a little olive oil, the other clove of sliced garlic, your basil stalks and the tomatoes, then fill one of the empty tomato tins with cold water and add this too.",
      "Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down, add a pinch of salt and pepper and the sugar, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until you get a loose tomato sauce consistency. Then take the pan off the heat and add the basil leaves.",
      "By now the spinach will have cooled down, so squeeze any excess liquid out of it and pour this back into the bowl. Finely chop the spinach and put it back into the bowl. Mix it with the liquid, add the ricotta and a handful of the Parmesan, and then use a piping bag to squeeze the mixture into the cannelloni. You can make your own piping bag by getting a sandwich bag and putting the spinach mix into the corner of it. Then twist the bag up and cut the corner off. Carefully squeeze the filling into the cannelloni tubes so each one is filled right up – really easy.",
      "Lay the cannelloni over the tomato sauce in the pan. Or you can pour the tomato sauce into your ovenproof dish and lay the cannelloni on top.",

When buying asparagus, have a look around because there are lots of varieties available now - purple-tipped, white, thin straggly Japanese, wild Spanish and dozens of good locally grown English. In this recipe, the stalks are finely sliced to an inch below the tips - this will give you lots of flavour from the stalks and you'll then have those whole beautiful tips as a bit of a prize! There are variations on this risotto that I love to do, like sprinkling in a little picked crab or lobster meat or fresh, peeled prawns or sliced scallops - all of these work particularly well with asparagus if you fancy a little upgrade.

Five years on and nothing's changed, but I wanted to get him cooking, so this is something I invented for him to try out. It's so easy to make because all it involves is throwing a few things into the pot and leaving it in the oven for a while. In Andy's case, he'll go to a football match while it's cooking so it's ready as soon as he gets home. ”",

      "Knead the pieces of dough together – with a bit of work and some love and attention they’ll all bind together to give you one big, smooth lump of dough!",
      "Once you’ve made your dough you need to knead and work it with your hands to develop the gluten in the flour, otherwise your pasta will be flabby and soft when you cook it, instead of springy and al dente. There’s no secret to kneading. You just have to bash the dough about a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, pulling it, stretching it, squashing it again. It’s quite hard work, and after a few minutes it’s easy to see why the average Italian grandmother has arms like Frank Bruno! You’ll know when to stop – it’s when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky instead of rough and floury.",
      "Wrap the dough in clingfilm and put it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes – make sure the clingfilm covers it well or it will dry out and go crusty round the edges (this will give you crusty lumps through your pasta when you roll it out, and nobody likes crusty lumps!).",
      "How to roll your pasta: first of all, if you haven't got a pasta machine it's not the end of the world! All the mammas I met while travelling round Italy rolled pasta with their trusty rolling pins and they wouldn't even consider having a pasta machine in the house! When it comes to rolling, the main problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. It's quite difficult to get a big lump of dough rolled out in one piece, and you need a very long rolling pin to do the job properly. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces of pasta rather than a few big ones. You'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than the long rectangular shapes you'll get from a machine, but use your head and you'll be all right!",
      "If using a machine to roll your pasta, make sure it's clamped firmly to a clean work surface before you start (use the longest available work surface you have). If your surface is cluttered with bits of paper, the kettle, the bread bin, the kids' homework and stuff like that, shift all this out of the way for the time being. It won't take a minute, and starting with a clear space to work in will make things much easier, I promise.",
      "Dust your work surface with some Tipo 00 flour, take a lump of pasta dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips. Set the pasta machine at its widest setting - and roll the lump of pasta dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks at all.",
      "Click the machine down a setting and roll the pasta dough through again. Fold the pasta in half, click the pasta machine back up to the widest setting and roll the dough through again. Repeat this process five or six times. It might seem like you're getting nowhere, but in fact you're working the dough, and once you've folded it and fed it through the rollers a few times, you'll feel the difference. It'll be smooth as silk and this means you're making wicked pasta!",
      "Now it's time to roll the dough out properly, working it through all the settings on the machine, from the widest down to around the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the pasta with a little flour every time you run it through.",
      "When you've got down to the narrowest setting, to give yourself a tidy sheet of pasta, fold the pasta in half lengthways, then in half again, then in half again once more until you've got a square-ish piece of dough. Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll it down through the settings for the last time, you should end up with a lovely rectangular silky sheet of dough with straight sides - just like a real pro! If your dough is a little cracked at the edges, fold it in half just once, click the machine back two settings and feed it through again. That should sort things out.",
      "Whether you're rolling by hand or by machine you'll need to know when to stop. If you're making pasta like tagliatelle, lasagne or stracchi you'll need to roll the pasta down to between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card; if you're making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini, you'll need to roll it down slightly thinner or to the point where you can clearly see your hand or lines of newsprint through it.",
      "Once you've rolled your pasta the way you want it, you need to shape or cut it straight away. Pasta dries much quicker than you think, so whatever recipe you're doing, don't leave it more than a minute or two before cutting or shaping it. You can lay over a damp clean tea towel which will stop it from drying."

      "Tip into a blender, drizzle in 100ml of extra virgin olive oil, then add the rum, lime juice, fresh chilli (deseed if you like), and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.",
      "Pour in 200ml of water, whiz until smooth, then have a taste and adjust with a bit more salt, chilli or lime juice, if needed.",

      "Season with salt and pepper, then squeeze in most of the lime juice and add a good lug of extra virgin olive oil. Mix together on the board, then have a taste and tweak, if needed. Scrape into a bowl.",
      "For the steaks, get a frying pan, griddle pan or barbecue screaming hot and season both sides of the steaks with salt, pepper and a good drizzle of olive oil.",
      "Place the steaks into the pan, turning every minute until cooked to your liking. I’m going to give you some rough timings, but use your intuition: a 200g steak about 2cm thick wants about 2 minutes each side for medium-rare and 3 minutes each side for medium. As it cooks, whip the meat with the sprig of rosemary and rub it with the cut-side of the garlic clove for extra flavour.",
      "When the steaks are cooked to your liking, leave to rest for a few minutes, then slice 1cm thick. Spread the peanut sauce over a large serving platter or divide between plates, and place the steak on top.",
      "Finish with a few dollops of salsa, and scatter over the reserved coriander. Drizzle over any resting juices and let everyone tuck in. Delicious served with Mexican street salad."

      "Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic. Heat a splash of olive oil in a very large casserole pan on a medium-high heat, drain and add the chunks of pig’s ear, tail and trotter and pork belly and fry for 15 minutes, or until golden and gnarly.",
      "At this point, go in with three-quarters of the chopped onions, and all the garlic, bay leaves and paprika.",
      "Slice up the bacon and chorizo 2cm thick, cut the ribs up, then add it all to the pan and cook for 15 minutes, stirring regularly.",
      "When the time’s up, pour the beans into the meat pan with enough of their cooking water to cover everything nicely. Cook on a low heat for 3 hours, or until the meat is tender, stirring occasionally, and topping up with a little more water, if needed.",
      "To make the salsa, peel the onion, deseed the tomatoes and pepper, then very finely chop them with the top leafy half of the parsley, mixing as you go. In a bowl, dress with the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and vinegar, then taste and season to perfection.",
      "Just before you’re ready to serve, tear off the leaves of the spring greens, roll up and slice them 1cm thick, then cook with the remaining chopped onions and a splash of olive oil in a large pan on a high heat for 5 minutes.",
      "Season the feijoada to taste, then serve with fluffy rice, your spring greens, salsa and plenty of cold beers. To be truly authentic, you want a little bowl of toasted cassava flour on the side to dip each mouthful in, and some hot pickled chillies. Santos also recommends a few fresh wedges of orange to cut through the intensity of the sauce – delicious."

      "1 large aubergine",

      "4 cloves of garlic",
      "10 cm piece of ginger",
      "4 tablespoons rogan josh curry paste",
      "groundnut oil",

      "1 mug basmati rice , (320g)",
      "1 fresh red chilli",
      "1 handful of fresh curry leaves",
      "1 teaspoon mustard seeds"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.",
      "Cut the aubergine into 2cm chunks, peel and slice the onions and garlic, peel and finely grate the ginger.",
      "Put all this into a large high-sided roasting tray with the curry paste and a lug of groundnut oil. Toss together until well coated, then roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until sticky and caramelized.",
      "Remove half the roasted veg to a large pan to start your daal and return the tray to the oven to keep warm – turn the oven off so that the veg don’t dry out.",
      "Place the pan on a low heat on the hob. Stir in the split peas, crumble in the stock cube and add 2 litres of boiling water.",
      "Simmer for around 1 hour 20 minutes with the lid on, or until the split peas are tender and the daal has thickened, stirring occasionally, and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed.",
      "Meanwhile, place the flour in a large bowl with a pinch of sea salt and make a well in the middle. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 150ml of water to the well and mix together with a fork.",
      "When it comes together as dough, tip it on to a flour-dusted surface, knead until smooth, then divide into 12 balls. Roll each one into a circle, nice and thin, turning as you go and dusting with a little extra flour, if needed.",
      "Put a frying pan on a medium heat and cook the chapatis for 1 minute on each side, or until cooked but not coloured. Stack them in tin foil as you go and keep them warm until needed.",
      "Put 1 mug of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat with the lid on for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.",
      "Meanwhile, to make the flavoured oil (called a temper), finely slice the chilli and place it in a small frying pan on a medium heat with the curry leaves, mustard seeds and a good lug of groundnut oil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until crispy.",
      "Load up your warm chapatis with rice, daal and a scattering of roasted veggies, drizzle over the temper, roll up and tuck in."
