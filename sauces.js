      "“It’s a joy to partake in the ritual of making a good aïoli. The process has broken many a cook – not because it’s hard or complicated, but because it’s an emulsification of oil and egg yolk: add too much oil too quickly and it can easily split – this method demands focus. So why do it? Most shop-bought mayo, which would be the base, doesn’t use good oil, so here you have the power to make something lip-smackingly special. An aïoli is similar to a mayonnaise, but it’s pungent and almost spicy with the hum of raw garlic. It’s a boisterous condiment that, when made well and used in the right dish with restraint, is phenomenal. When a blob hits a hot soup, what might be too much in its raw state mingles to become something fantastic, and, when a small spoonful is rubbed across hot toast with cold roasted meats or dressed crab and a little lemon, you’ll discover a whole new level of deliciousness. So treat it more like Tabasco or English mustard, just like an antagonist. ”",

The results are incredible, so it’s worth the time and effort to get it right.",

Add this puréed mixture to the pan and cook for another minute. Add the sugar, stir in well and cook for a few more minutes, until it begins to dissolve and you get a thick brown paste. Pour in 285ml of water and cook for 2 more minutes, then squeeze in the juice of both your oranges and add all the remaining ingredients along with 1 teaspoon each of sea salt and black pepper. Stir well and bring everything to the boil, then turn down the heat a touch and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture starts to thicken slightly.",

If you want to keep it for longer, you’ll have to sterilize some jars. It’s dead easy. Either put them in the sink along with their lids and cover them completely with boiling water from the kettle; or fill a really large pan with water, bring it to the boil, then immerse the jars and lids and continue to boil for 10 minutes; or, if you’ve got a good dishwasher with a really hot cycle, run them through that.",

Generally, this ratio is a really good benchmark for making any dressing, but it’s always sensible to have a little taste once you’ve shaken it up. If the seasoning is there but you’re finding it a little too acidic, you’ve cracked it, because once the dressing is on the salad leaves it will be perfect. ”",

    ingredients: [
      "320 g fresh veg , such as baby carrots, radishes, romaine lettuce, radicchio, young asparagus, celery",
      "Minted yoghurt dip",
      "200 ml fat-free natural yoghurt",
      "1-2 handfuls of fresh mint",
      "2 handfuls of fresh podded peas",
      "1 handful of Parmesan cheese , freshly grated",
      "½ lemon",
    ],
    instructions: [
      "This dish is only as good as the vegetables you buy, so use that as your starting point and you'll be on to an absolute winner! Here are some tips on buying and preparing a selection of veg...",
      "In most supermarkets these days you can get fresh baby carrots with their green tops. Leave about an inch of the tops on and just give the carrots a scrub.",
      "Do the same with some lovely radishes. You can get some marbled pink and white oval ones now, which are crunchy and peppery. Again, leave the tops on as these make good handles when it comes to dipping.",
      "Use nice crunchy lettuces. Sweeter lettuces like cos and romaine are good for dipping – I try to use the inner part, keeping the outer leaves for another salad. I leave the stalk on and then cut the lettuce into quarters, and that way they stay in one piece, but you don't have to do this. The important thing is to get good chunks of vegetables. I like to contrast the sweet lettuces with slightly more bitter ones like radicchio or endive.",
      "If you've got some young asparagus that's just come into season, it's really nice eaten raw. Feel free to use your imagination on the veggie side. Little fingers of celery or celeriac are also good. However, you often come across people who use raw cauliflower with dips – I personally would prefer colonic irrigation! I think cauliflower and broccoli are just awful eaten raw, so I wouldn't suggest using them here.",
      "Put the yoghurt in a food processor, pick in the mint leaves and whiz up for half a minute or so. Add the peas and the Parmesan, and whiz again – the peas will break down and the yoghurt will become green.",
      "Put the dip in a bowl, correcting the seasoning with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. When you add the lemon juice and peas to the yoghurt, quite often it splits and turns into a kind of cheese, but this is absolutely fine. It depends on the type of yoghurt you use and how acidic your lemon is. Just pour away any excess water. Usually, though, it doesn't split and is more like a purée, but both ways are good.",
      "Serve your veggies on a big board or in a big bowl next to the dip. And have some salt and pepper to hand in case you need it. It's a good sociable way to start a meal.",

    instructions: [
      "To make your gravy\nWhen you come to make your gravy, your chicken will be covered and resting and you’ll have your tray of chicken juices and vegetable trivet in front of you. Using a spoon, carefully remove 90 per cent of the hot fat from the tray by angling it away from yourself and scooping off the fatty layer that settles on top.",
      "Put the tray back on the hob over a high heat. Add the flour, stir it around and, holding the tray steady with a tea towel in one hand, use a potato masher to mash all the veg to a pulp – don’t worry if it’s lumpy. You can rip the wings off the chicken and break them up into the tray to add more flavour at this point.",
      "When everything is mixed and mashed up, add the alcohol to give a little fragrance before you add your stock (the alcohol will cook away). Keep it over the heat and let it boil for a few minutes. Pour the stock into the tray, or add 1 litre of hot water. Bring everything in the pan to the boil, scraping all the goodness from the bottom of the pan as you go. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until you’ve achieved the gravy consistency you’re looking for.",
      "To serve your gravy\nGet yourself a large jug, bowl or pan and put a coarse sieve over it. Pour your gravy through the sieve, using a ladle to really push all the goodness through. Discard any veg or meat left behind. At this point you’ve got a really cracking gravy, and you can either serve it straight away or put it back on the heat to simmer and thicken up.",
